              <p>Our goal is to use deep learning networks to understand which neurons in the brain encode fine motor movements in mice. We collected large datasets entailing calcium imaging data of active neurons and high-resolution videos when mice perform motor tasks. We want to use recent advances in deep learning to (1) estimate the poses of mouse body parts at a high spatiotemporal resolution (2) extract behaviorally-relevant information and (3) align them with neural activity data. Behavioral video analysis is made possible by transfer learning, the ability to take a network that was trained on a task with a large supervised dataset and utilize it on a small supervised dataset.

Recently, such algorithms were tailored for use in the laboratory in a Python-based toolbox known as DeepLabCut, providing a tool for high-throughput behavioral video analysis.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The project has three parts: (1) Train neural networks through frame extraction and posture annotation using DeepLabCut, (2) Apply network to large datasets using DeepLabCut and extract behaviorally-relevant information using Python/Matlab custom-written scripts, (3) Align behavioral data with neural activity data and perform cross-correlations using Python or Matlab custom-written scripts. Ultimately this project will allow to understand the relationship between motor function and neural activity in specific cell-types in the brain. The data science tools acquired by the student have multiple applications, either in circuit neuroscience (e.g. animal behavior, deep brain imaging) or in computer vision (eg animal or human pose/posture estimation).</p>

<li><p>International students on F1 or J1 visa: <strong>eligible</strong></p></li>

<li><p>Additional comments:</p>

<ul>
<li>High level of independence (the primary mentor is an expert in biological data collection in mouse models, but not an expert in data analysis. There are several people with data experience available in the lab to ask questions). It is expected that the student will be the main driver for the development of the data processing and analysis (with support/discussion with us).</li>
<li>Highly self-motivated, passionate, driven, ambitious.</li>
<li>Desire to bring projects to completion.</li>
<li>Good organizational and communication skills (to present work to scientists)</li>
<li>Interest in neuroscience, in particular calcium imaging of individual cell populations or motor function.</li>
<li>Pros: possibility to contribute to a larger research project expected to be published in a peer-reviewed publication in 2020-2021, student will be integrated into a neuroscience research team and can learn about the experimental side of neuroscience. Mentoring will include weekly/biweekly discussions with mentor (experimentalist) and a collaborator with previous experience with DeepLabCut. Possibility to present data in the form of posters/talks. Will be given full responsibility and credit for contribution, that can be acknowledged as authorship in publication, letter of recommendations, etc. depending on the level of achievement.</li>

<p>The goal of the DSI Scholars Program is to engage Columbia University&rsquo;s undergraduate and master&rsquo;s students in data science research with Columbia faculty through a research internship. The program connects students with research projects across Columbia and provides student researchers with an additional learning experience and networking opportunities. Through unique enrichment activities, this program aims to foster a learning and collaborative community in data science at Columbia.</p>

<p>The Data For Good Scholars program connects student volunteers to organizations and individuals working for the social good whose projects have developed a need for data science expertise. As &ldquo;real world&rdquo; problems with real world data, these projects are excellent opportunities for students to learn how data science is practiced outside of the university setting and to learn how to work effectively with people for whom data science sits outside of their subject area.</p></div>

Epigenomics 2019) where we can investigate trajectories of multiple molecular features of aging over long time periods. The underlying multi-omic dataset includes epigenomic (DNA methylation), proteomic (protein abundance), bioenergetics (mitochondrial respiration), telomere length, and various secreted factors. A major challenge for the DSI Fellow will be to integrate the multi-omic dataset to capture dynamic signatures of mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular aging, working collaboratively with other scientists. The existing project is expected to result in one or more publications. Possibility to continue work for pay over the summer.</p>

Usually the “data analysis and visualization”-pipeline is built from scratch for each new experiment resulting in a significant amount of code duplication and wasted effort in rebuilding the analysis tools. There is a growing need for a unified system to automate much of the repetitive tasks and aid biologists in understanding their data more efficiently.</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather"><p>We aim to augment recovery in spinal cord (SC) injured patients. Electrical stimulation of the SC can facilitate recovery, but the mechanisms are not yet understood. One knowledge gap lies in the exact pathways that are recruited by stimulation. To close this gap, we have tested the effects of SC stimulation in people undergoing clinically indicated surgery. By testing the distribution and size of muscle responses to SC stimulation, we can infer which circuits are activated. We are also examining how SC injury changes those responses. We propose to use Bayesian methods to understand the  interaction between muscle responses to stimulation and the MRI indicated pattern of damage. The project will involve construction of models linking multiple data modalities that predict muscle activity, followed by the modification of these models to account for patterns of damage. Construction of such models would enable a deeper understanding of SC stimulation leading to more effective stimulation paradigms.</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather"><p>Our goal is to use deep learning networks to understand which neurons in the brain encode fine motor movements in mice. We collected large datasets entailing calcium imaging data of active neurons and high-resolution videos when mice perform motor tasks. We want to use recent advances in deep learning to (1) estimate the poses of mouse body parts at a high spatiotemporal resolution (2) extract behaviorally-relevant information and (3) align them with neural activity data. Behavioral video analysis is made possible by transfer learning, the ability to take a network that was trained on a task with a large supervised dataset and utilize it on a small supervised dataset. This has been used e.g. in a human pose–estimation algorithm called DeeperCut. Recently, such algorithms were tailored for use in the laboratory in a Python-based toolbox known as DeepLabCut, providing a tool for high-throughput behavioral video analysis.</p>

We seek a research assistant who can (1) develop image classification to be applied to satellite imagery to determine extent and abundance of bauxite dust within specific communities in the Boké region (2) develop methods to make classified images available for download to smartphones in the field and (3) adapt existing application technologies to allow users in the field to upload field photographs and locations of potential impacts they identify. The resulting map would represent a composite of satellite imaged areas of impact verified in the field and documentation of other areas of impact not visible by satellite but already identified in the field.</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather"><p>42% of New York City greenhouse gas emissions result from on-site fossil fuel combustion in residential and commercial buildings; space heating is, by far, the majority contributor. Both New York State and NYC have policies to dramatically reduce emissions that will require a transformation in the way buildings are heated, including major efforts in existing buildings. This transition is inextricably linked to existing energy equity issues that we believe significantly overlap across NYC (and elsewhere). These include unreliable heating in the winter, susceptibility to extreme heat (an increasing occurrence with climate change) and struggles to afford energy needs. Various known data sources for NYC are available, though they are disparate and have not been analyzed holistically. Further, we believe there are potential engineering and policy solutions to these challenges. In this project, the DSI scholar will access (and search for where not yet known to qSEL researchers) relevant data sets, analyze those data sets to identify communities exposed to all or a subset of these issues, and assist qSEL researchers in developing models to evaluate possible solutions. The project has the possibility of extending through Summer 2020, subject to fundraising efforts and the success of the Spring 2020 project.</p>
