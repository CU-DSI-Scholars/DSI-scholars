<li><p><strong>Question:</strong> How does the DSI Scholars stipend/matching fund process work?</p>

<p><em>Answer</em>: Stipends are issued directly by Student Financial Services in coordination with the Data Science Institute. PIs for selected projects will be asked to make a commitment as to the level of their support, after which the DSI will arrange for the stipend to be issued. Simultaneously, the DSI staff will work with the PI&rsquo;s department administrators to transfer the base amount to the DSI. <em>Please note</em>: stipends are only issued once per term (fall, spring, summer), so if a deadline is missed there may be some delay in arranging a payment to your student.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Question:</strong> Why is the stipend mechanism used? Can I hire a student directly and still receive the matching fund?</p>

<p><em>Answer</em>: The DSI scholars program is a research experience program that provides a stipend to defray incidentials incurred during a research internship. To hire a research assistant directly, faculty can submit their project to <a href="https://www.datascience.columbia.edu/connections">Campus Connections</a> and indicate their preference.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Question:</strong> Is it required to use the stipend during a specific term?</p>

<p><em>Answer</em>: No, it is up to the PI to decide how to use the fund. However, we strongly recommend that time spent during the academic year is compensated with academic credit and that the stipend be used during the summer to support an internship. The primary benefit to students in the program is the experience provided.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Question:</strong> My project wasn&rsquo;t selected for a matching fund. Can the DSI still help me find a student?</p>

<p><em>Answer</em>: Yes. We are happy to provide match-making services to as many projects as possible. Selected students will still be eligible for educational support activities.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Question:</strong> I don&rsquo;t have any funds of my own. Can I still participate?</p>

<p><em>Answer</em>: You can still recruit students through the program, but your project will not be eligible for matching funds. It is possible to structure your project as an unpaid internship, however it is important to abide by federal and state regulations. The ISSO maintains a valuable <a href="https://isso.columbia.edu/content/unpaid-internships-and-volunteering">overview</a> of these regulations as they apply to all students. Projects focused on the social good may also seek volunteers through our Data For Good program. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:dsi-scholars@columbia.edu">dsi-scholars@columbia.edu</a> for further information.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Question:</strong> I&rsquo;m not sure that my project is a good fit for the program. Are there any other options?</p>

<p><em>Answer</em>: Yes. The DSI maintains a number of programs that can connect you with student or faculty resources. Please submit your project through <a href="https://www.datascience.columbia.edu/connections">Campus Connections</a>, or contact us at <a href="mailto:dsi-scholars@columbia.edu">dsi-scholars@columbia.edu</a>. Please see <a href="../../page/dsi_programs">here</a> for high-level overview of DSI programs.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Question:</strong> Can I select more than one student?</p>

<p><em>Answer</em>: Yes. It is up to PIs to determine the best way for their projects to proceed.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Question:</strong> I missed the deadline to apply, can I still participate?</p>

<p><em>Answer</em>: Yes. If there is still is time, we will add your project to the umbrella application. If there is not time, the DSI maintains a number of ways to help you recruit students. In either case, please submit your project through <a href="https://datascience.columbia.edu/outreach/campus-connections/">Campus Connections</a>.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Question:</strong> Will there be another call in the future?</p>

<p><em>Answer</em>: Yes, calls for applications go out every August for the fall and every December for the spring/summer.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Question:</strong> My project was selected for a matching fund, but I missed the term deadline to submit a student. Is my project still eligible for support?</p>

<p><em>Answer</em>: Yes. However, as we issue stipends only once per term, there may be some delay in arranging a payment to your student. Please note that graduating students are only eligible for stipends so long as they are currently enrolled at the time the stipend request is made with the Student Financial Services office.</p></li>

<p>The goal of the DSI Scholars Program is to engage Columbia University&rsquo;s undergraduate and master&rsquo;s students in data science research with Columbia faculty through a research internship. The program connects students with research projects across Columbia and provides student researchers with an additional learning experience and networking opportunities. Through unique enrichment activities, this program aims to foster a learning and collaborative community in data science at Columbia.</p>

<p>The Data For Good Scholars program connects student volunteers to organizations and individuals working for the social good whose projects have developed a need for data science expertise. As &ldquo;real world&rdquo; problems with real world data, these projects are excellent opportunities for students to learn how data science is practiced outside of the university setting and to learn how to work effectively with people for whom data science sits outside of their subject area.</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather"><p>Immune checkpoint blockade therapy has shown successful clinical outcomes in the treatment of  various solid tumors such as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and others. However, immune checkpoint inhibitors work best in patients who exhibit certain tumor biomarkers. In a collaboration with the Department of Hematology Oncology, the Department of Systems Biology, and the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University we aim to identify biomarkers which are associated with treatment outcome in patients with solid tumors who underwent immunotherapy. The project includes bioinformatic analysis of sequencing data. Mentoring and training will be provided.</p>

              <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather"><p>Freshwater supply is critical for managing and meeting human and ecological demands. However, while stocks of water in both natural and artificial reservoirs are helpful for increasing availability, droughts and floods, as well as whiplash events affect reliability on these systems, posing grave consequences on water users. This risk is particularly salient in the state of California, where many local communities have been plagued by extreme hydrological events. In this current research, we contribute to California&rsquo;s Water Data Challenge effort where a diverse group of volunteers convened to form a multi-disciplinary team that addresses the crucial issues of extreme events in California using data science approaches. Members include researchers and professionals who come from a range of backgrounds representing academia and private sectors. We combine a range of publicly available datasets with Machine Learning (ML) techniques to explore predictability of extreme events during Californiaâ€™s water years. More specifically, we use a variety of water districts and showcase how ML prediction models are not only able to predict the flow of water at varying time horizons, they capture uncertainties posed by the climate and human influences.</p>

The FCC publishes a large dataset of network measurements from thousands of homes, with gigabytes of data. The project goal is to analyze the data and answer questions such as: Has the increased usage reduced internet speeds? Can we tell how much people are staying at home from data usage records? Is the increased use of video conferencing reflected in the upload metrics?</p>
