      <title>Application of Gaussian Mixture Regression to obtain useful, actionable air pollution data from consumer-grade, low-cost monitoring devices</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our primary objective for this work will be to build a GMR model that can correct for bias in low cost particulate matter (PM2.5) sensors to be used globally. We will select 5-10 diverse reference PM2.5 and low cost PM2.5 co-locations to build a Gaussian Mixture Regression model (GMR). Recently, our team showed that GMR provides a higher quality correction factor for PurpleAir PM2.5 sensors than multiple linear regression and random forest, in terms of both correlation and accuracy. We then plan to evaluate this model on at least 20 independent co-location datasets that the GMR has not seen. There has been an exciting recent rise in commercially available low-cost sensors (LCS), such as PurpleAir (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.purpleair.com&#34;&gt;www.purpleair.com&lt;/a&gt;) and Clarity sensors, which when paired with machine learning (ML) based correction algorithms demonstrate high accuracy compared to co-located reference grade monitors5,6. So far, these corrections have been limited to the few LCS locations which are co-located with expensive reference-grade monitors, while the potential from the thousands of un-co-located sensors remains untapped. PurpleAir and similar devices have been deployed all over the world. Ideally our global correction factor will allow for the extraction of more trustworthy data from huge open-access databases of air pollution data such as PurpleAir.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Columbia University &lt;a href=&#34;http://datascience.columbia.edu/&#34;&gt;Data Science Institute&lt;/a&gt; is pleased to announce that the Data Science Institute (DSI) and Data For Good Scholars programs for Spring 2022 are open for application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the DSI Scholars Program is to engage Columbia University&amp;rsquo;s undergraduate and master&amp;rsquo;s students in data science research with Columbia faculty through a research internship. The program connects students with research projects across Columbia and provides student researchers with an additional learning experience and networking opportunities. Through unique enrichment activities, this program aims to foster a learning and collaborative community in data science at Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Data For Good Scholars program connects student volunteers to organizations and individuals working for the social good whose projects have developed a need for data science expertise. As &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo; problems with real world data, these projects are excellent opportunities for students to learn how data science is practiced outside of the university setting and to learn how to work effectively with people for whom data science sits outside of their subject area.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Comparison of four workflows for structural variants identification</title>
      <link>https://cu-dsi-scholars.github.io/DSI-scholars/2022/01/project-comparison-of-four-workflows-for-structural-variants-identification/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in genomic technologies have led to the identification of many novel disease-gene associations, enabling more precise diagnoses. Along with the technologies enabling rapid DNA sequencing, multiple computational approaches have been developed to identify structural variants (i.e. relatively large deletions and duplications of genomic sequences). These workflows can lead to the identification of different structural variants, raising the risk of missing disease-causing variants when using only one of those methods. Unfortunately, many of the variants identified by those workflows are artifacts (i.e. absent in the biological sample), raising concerns that time and effort will be wasted on those artifacts instead of analyzing the causative genetic variant. The goal of this project is to develop best practices to increase the chance to identify causative structural variants, while reducing the number of artifacts. We will use the raw data from whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing of patients with renal diseases. The students will be expected to (1) Compare the output of 4 different tools for identifying structural variants and visualize the differences (using R or Python) and (2) Identify the tool specific parameters that increases the specificity and sensitivity of each tool in differentiating true variants and artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has long been recognized that there could be a tradeoff between optimizing the accuracy of machine learning predictions and satisfying definitions of fairness for protected or vulnerable groups. This tradeoff has led to an increased interest in finding models that both perform well while also exhibiting fairness properties.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The IGM has performed diagnostic whole exome or whole genome sequencing on more than 5000 CUIMC patients with presentations including undiagnosed diseases of childhood, chronic kidney disease, fetal anomalies and neurological diseases (with a focus on epilepsy) among many others. These patients have been analyzed with a standardized diagnostic pipeline to identify single genotypes that are responsible for disease. Diagnostic genotypes are those that are considered to be likely contributing to the patient’s presentation through study team consensus (a multidisciplinary team that includes population geneticists, molecular geneticists, clinicians, genetic counselors, bioinformaticians and analysts). The student will be expected to 1) build an easy-to-use interface and secure database for variant records and phenotype information, and 2) implement a web interface to facilitate variant submission to ClinVar which is a freely accessible, public archive of reports of the relationships among human variations and phenotypes, with supporting evidence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the methods to identify novel gene-disease associations is called “trio analysis”, when an affected child (proband) and both his/her parents DNA are sequenced. The genetic information from the child and his/her parents allows for the rapid identification of compound heterozygous variants (i.e. 2 variants in the same gene, one inherited from the mother and the other one from the father).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project aims to create/develop a smartphone application for use with our pediatric cardiology patients. The application would be a &amp;ldquo;patient passport,&amp;rdquo; which essentially would be a snapshot of their most critical medical information. It will not be linked to the clinical health records; rather, it needs to be a template with various questions that we would create (name, diagnosis, surgeries, current medications, etc). The doctor would fill out the information with the patient, and it would then be saved on the patient&amp;rsquo;s phone for them to show other healthcare professionals. We are looking for a student who can help us design this app (from a technological perspective) and get it up and running. It would need to be encrypted and password protected.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;5G-and-beyond networks will utilize data transmissions at millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies to improve data throughput and wireless spectrum utilization. Recently, there is interest in utilizing mmWave frequencies for fixed wireless access (FWA), which can provide Internet connectivity to buildings which do not currently have good service. FWA requires a much lower infrastructure investment than running fiber optic or copper cables into a premise, which remains by far the predominant method of providing Internet access to a building today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The brain is the most complex organ of the body, and hosts a multitude of cell types organized in functionally-specialized brain regions. So far, systematic attempts to describe the complexity of the brain have been limited to a few species, including mouse and the fruit fly. Extending the description of brains to multiple species is essential to identify evolutionarily-conserved principles of brain organization and function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://cu-dsi-scholars.github.io/DSI-scholars/2022/01/project-intelligent-spectrum-coordination-for-future-wireless-networks/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The wireless revolution is fueling the demand for access to the radio frequency spectrum. Smartphones, wearables, modern cars, and smart homes are all competing for spectrum resources. Managing this increasing demand is an important and timely research challenge. Dynamic Spectrum Allocation (DSA) methods allow multiple wireless networks to collaboratively adapt in real-time to dynamic RF frequency environments. In this project, we consider intelligent wireless networks that exchange Spectrum Consumption Models (SCMs) in order to dynamically coordinate the spectrum usage aiming to avoid harmful interference. Students working on this project will construct SCMs based on real measurements of wireless signals, develop novel frequency coordination protocols based on SCMs, and implement the protocols in a custom-built python simulator and/or in a Software-Defined Radio testbed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This team project aims to investigate different approaches to presenting individuals with daily suggestions for meeting their nutritional goals. Specifically, we are interested in developing new mechanisms for choosing suggestions that satisfy an individual’s’ preferences and habits (e.g., similar to an individual’s previous meals, based on the analysis of textual meal descriptions), comparing effectiveness of meal recommendations that are expressed as text versus those expressed as images of meals, and developing ways to balance an individual’s preferences with exposing them to new meal ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The project will use Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate space-time correlated renewable generation scenarios. The student will gather historical wind speed and solar radiation data from Texas, and train a GAN to generate scenarios. The student will also investigate the scenario correlation with temperature, and use average temperature as a key feature for scenario generation, and benchmark it with alternative scenario generation approaches. This effort is part of a storage valuation project funded by DSI Seed Grant in 2022, in which these generated scenarios will be used for performing storage valuation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Discriminatory development policies have systematically relegated certain populations to undesirable locations including low elevation areas at risk of flooding. As the climate changes, many properties will no longer be inhabitable and others, especially houses in floodplains, will suffer damage due to more frequent and significant flooding. Current U.S. federal policy funds flood risk mitigation measures, such as property  acquisition, relocation and retrofitting, however depending on various factors at the sub-county level, these actions can have disproportionate benefit to high income areas and not extend to vulnerable populations. We investigate patterns related to potential disproportionate availability and access to government linked programs, exploring different types of climatic factors using flood insurance claims data from NFIP. Work with the intern will build off existing research on programmatic wide and event specific analysis in the Carolinas to explore patterns that may be of interest specifically to state and county level decision makers to evaluate how communities are benefiting from existing programs and to ensure equity. We plan to publish an event specific research article using high resolution data on the distribution of risks and benefits following a major disaster.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Structural variants (SVs) are large genomic alterations which can be implicated in disease. This project will focus on using novel genomic techniques to identify structural variants in genomic cold cases with neurological disorders. These &amp;ldquo;cold&amp;rdquo; cases which have previously remained unsolved with standard genomic approaches. We will use optical genome mapping and long read sequencing, together with novel bioinformatic techniques to detect and analyze structural variants.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://cu-dsi-scholars.github.io/DSI-scholars/2022/01/project-urban-design-and-childrens-mobility-and-crash-risks-in-us-cities/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Road traffic crashes involving child passengers, child pedestrians, and child bicyclists are the leading cause of death for people aged 5 to 15 years in the USA. A total of 10,344 children died on US roads in the decade from 2010-2019; a further 4.2 million were hospitalized. Urban design—meaning the overall physical form of cities—is a modifiable environmental feature that can be changed to reduce the immense burden due to child road traffic injuries. Altering the overall configuration of a city’s transportation network affects the way children and other road users routinely travel through urban space, thereby altering children’s risks for being injured or killed in a road traffic crash.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://cu-dsi-scholars.github.io/DSI-scholars/2022/01/project-weather-effects-on-high-frequency-communication-links/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Future wireless networks will use high-frequency millimeter-wave (mmWave) links for transmitting and receiving information with high throughput. A key difference between mmWave links and conventional sub-6GHz links is that mmWave links are severely affected by weather conditions. Students working on this project will use a state-of-the-art mmWave radar to assess the impact of wind speed, temperature, humidity, and other factors on the high-frequency link. The end goal of the project is to develop a classifier that can infer weather conditions based on the signal received from the mmWave radar. In this project, students are expected to learn how the mmWave radar works, design experiments to obtain labeled data, perform measurements, and develop the classifier.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the DSI Scholars Program is to engage Columbia University&amp;rsquo;s undergraduate and master&amp;rsquo;s students in data science research with Columbia faculty through a research internship. The program connects students with research projects across Columbia and provides student researchers with an additional learning experience and networking opportunities. Through unique enrichment activities, this program aims to foster a learning and collaborative community in data science at Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Data For Good Scholars program connects student volunteers to organizations and individuals working for the social good whose projects have developed a need for data science expertise. As &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo; problems with real world data, these projects are excellent opportunities for students to learn how data science is practiced outside of the university setting and to learn how to work effectively with people for whom data science sits outside of their subject area.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The WHO has identified scientific misinformation as a public health crisis, calling it an “infodemic.” Social media allows misinformation to spread quickly and out-compete scientifically grounded information. Dear Pandemic is an innovative, multidisciplinary, social media-based science communication project led by women scientists across several institutions around the US and the UK. The mission is to educate and empower individuals to successfully navigate the overwhelming amount of information. The goals are: 1) To disseminate trustworthy, comprehensive, and timely scientific content about the pandemic to lay audiences, and 2) To promote media and health literacy, equipping readers to better manage the COVID-19 infodemic within their own networks. More than one year after launch, the project has a combined monthly reach of &amp;gt; 5 million people across 4 social media channels (2 Facebook pages in English and Spanish; Instagram; and Twitter).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The impact of an outage, congestion, hijacking, and many other Internet phenomena depends on how many users or how much traffic use the route, but researchers lack visibility into how important routes are, and, distressingly, seem to have lost hope of obtaining this information without proprietary datasets or privileged viewpoints. We believe that there is hope &amp;ndash; new measurement methods and changes in Internet structure make it possible to construct an “Internet Traffic Map” identifying the locations (logical and perhaps geographical) of Internet users and major services, the paths between users and major services, and the relative activity levels (traffic, queries, or number of users) routed along these paths. We will construct this map. The realization of an Internet Traffic Map will be an Internet-scale effort that will have Internet-scale consequences that reach far beyond the research community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>An Extension for the Brown Institute</title>
      <link>https://cu-dsi-scholars.github.io/DSI-scholars/2021/09/project-an-extension-for-the-brown-institute/</link>

      <guid>https://cu-dsi-scholars.github.io/DSI-scholars/2021/09/project-an-extension-for-the-brown-institute/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The pandemic brought with it a range of tools for virtual collaboration. In 2020, the Brown Institute space was taken offline and our events were virtual. The affordances of virtual platforms, and in particular the highly-programmable ohyay.co, quickly became obvious — people participated in events who ordinarily would not, either as presenters or as audience members, and scriptable interactions helped boost the depth of involvement in our discussions. As we begin returning to in-person events, we would like to hold onto the best properties of a virtual environment. Our proposal is for the development of a “multi-modal” Extension to the Brown Institute space. This will be a series of interventions both in ohyay.co as well as in the physical Brown Institute. Partnering with the original architect and with engineers from ohyay.co, the Brown Institute Extension will be a space for unique collaboration. The Extension will support and enhance our programming in the technical tools of journalism, including data+computation, data visualization, AR/VR, machine learning, natural language processing… and the list goes on. We hope to find an intern with an interest in HCI and computation to help us design and program our Extension.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is highly associated with antibiotic exposure, but it is uncertain which classes of antibiotics confer the greatest risk for CDI.  This project will use the MarketScan database, a large commercial insurance billing database containing 40 million patient records, outpatient antibiotic prescription data, and ICD-based disease information, to test for associations between specific antibiotic classes and risk for CDI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Immune checkpoint blockade therapy has shown successful clinical outcomes in the treatment of various solid tumors such as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), melanoma, non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and others. However, immune checkpoint inhibitors work best in patients who exhibit certain tumor biomarkers. In a collaboration with the Department of Hematology Oncology, the Department of Systems Biology, and the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University we aim to identify biomarkers which are associated with treatment outcome in patients with solid tumors who underwent immunotherapy. The project includes bioinformatic analysis of sequencing data. Mentoring and training will be provided.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Small molecule modulators have been transformative in immune-oncology, revealing the functional role of numerous immune pathways. The current paradigm for immunotherapy, however, excludes cancers such as PDA where MHC-I is not effectively expressed at the membrane. In this application, we combine an innovative chemical proteomic screening platform with genome wide CRISPR screening in advanced PDA models. The lead compounds and protein targets discovered herein should provide launching points for drug development programs to remove PDA’s cloak of invisibility from the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Landweber Lab is looking for a computational student to work with us to analyze long-read DNA sequence datasets from Oxford Nanopore and PacBio (so-called third generation sequencing platforms). These datasets were collected across a time-course while single cells of the genus Oxytricha are undergoing RNA-guided natural genome editing. This process leads to a completely different &amp;ldquo;output&amp;rdquo; product genome from the precursor &amp;ldquo;input&amp;rdquo; or germline genome, and has been compared to a cellular computer. The goal will be to capture and classify long reads in these DNA datasets that represent the intermediate steps in genome rearrangements, when chromosomes mix and match hundreds of thousands of precursor building blocks to assemble a mature genome of 18,000 new chromosomes during programmed nuclear development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>COVID-19 Evidence Retrieval and Synthesis Using PubMed Abstracts</title>

      <guid>https://cu-dsi-scholars.github.io/DSI-scholars/2021/09/project-covid-19-evidence-retrieval-and-synthesis-using-pubmed-abstracts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Evidence-based Medicine (EBM) is the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. The key difference between evidence-based medicine and traditional medicine is not that EBM considers the evidence while the latter does not, but rather that EBM demands better evidence. Given the exponential growth of the medical literature and the free text format of this big body of literature that hampers efficient evidence computing, researchers, patients and clinicians face significant challenges in evidence retrieval, appraisal, and synthesis. Our long-term goal is to develop natural language processing and text summarization methods to overcome these challenges. Our short-term goal is to build a computable evidence base for COVID-19 and to enable evidence synthesis and reasoning over COVID-19 study findings. Currently we have a database of structured data elements for PubMed abstracts for randomized controlled trials published within the past 20 years. For this scholar project, we expect the participating students to develop methods to analyze the evidence in our evidence base, to build COVID-19 knowledge graphs, and to enable evidence synthesis and appraisal at scale. On this basis, we will also compare the evidence in the literature to the evidence derived from the real world data of COVID-19 patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This DFG project is a collaboration with researchers from Pittsburgh and ThroughlinesEdu. We are developing a R Shiny-based dashboard that enables grades 3-8 students to interactively learn data science concepts and research methods through themes of environmental justice. The goal is to develop a stand-alone educational tool that is open source and accessible by all regardless of demographic background, which can then be integrated into the teaching curricula. To this end, we are developing static and dynamic visualizations (e.g., graphs, figures, maps) using data on natural disasters, climate, and sea levels, as well as relief allocation to areas impacted by natural disasters.The end product will be introduced to social studies teachers of various grades 3-8 who work at schools in underserved districts at the end of October 2021.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project is an exciting opportunity to work with FEM, a non-profit that aims to address social rights issues among rural communities in Colombia. The team is currently working with the mayor’s office in Cartagena, Colombia to access multiple datasets and data sources to establish who and where the extreme poor in Cartagena live. Her team piloted a smartphone-based collection strategy during IOTA Hurricane and obtained data on 4845 households in a very vulnerable area. The first data science challenge was to wrangle and analyze these data to better characterize the population and their needs. This part of the project was conducted in the Spring and Summer of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stroke is devastating when left untreated. Early treatment significantly improves outcomes, and can be reliably detected using the FAST exam, which specifically assesses facial asymmetry, arm weakness, and speech deficits for signs of stroke. Our project aims to use smartphone technology to build a stroke detection algorithm based on this exam. We have collected video data of hospitalized stroke patients performing aspects of the standard neurology exam, which includes the factors previously mentioned. The next step is to build an algorithm that can detect facial asymmetry using this data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://cu-dsi-scholars.github.io/DSI-scholars/2021/09/project-discovery-and-rescue-of-rare-sperm-cell-from-semen-samples/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While an normal semen sample contains hundreds of millions of sperm, men with azospermia have no sperm seen and azospermia represents an important cause of infertility. Men with azospermia typically have to use donor sperm in order to have a child.  However, extended manual search of semen samples in men with azospermia reveal single-digit numbers of sperm in ~80% of cases. These few sperm are sufficient to fertility eggs in the IVF lab and allow the men to be biological fathers.  Unfortunately, the manual search for sperm is only performed in a couple of sites in the world because of the enormous cost associated with having a specially trained andrologist search a sperm sample for roughly 8 hours. In this project, we aim to apply the semen sample to the custom designed microfluidics chip at a fixed flow rate. Next, several thousands of images will be captured at frame rate ranging between 4,000-40,000 fps using a high definition microscope camera as the sample flows through the microfluidics device. We will then build a training dataset of images with and without the rare cells of interest. These training datasets will be used to build an artificial intelligence (AI) model with high accuracy to detect rare cells of interest. The model will be tested for its accuracy on the ‘true’ sample containing rare cells. The Data Science Institute Scholar is expected to have basic programming skills (preferably in Python). Thus, if successful, there will literally be countless babies born as a result of this project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We performed a prospective, non-randomized trial of patients undergoing surgical management of gastrointestinal, gynecologic, and urologic malignancies between 2017 and 2021 . Participants were instructed to take immunonutrition formula three times daily for five days before and after surgery once cleared by the surgeon for clear liquid diet. The dietician tracked their adherence. We are looking to perform statistical analysis to look at the impact of immunonutrition intake on unadjusted and adjusted postoperative surgical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We are looking for motivated mentees to help us organize and analyze a wide-breadth of patient data from the Columbia-New York Presbyterian data warehouse to understand the impact of the interventions on patient outcomes. The mentee would work alongside highly experienced biostatisticians and our Center&amp;rsquo;s professionalized data team managers. The mentee will develop expertise in analyzing health system data and will inform decisions to modify, sustain, or de-implement existing programs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The aims of this project are two-fold. We seek to: 1) better understand the associations of discrimination with sleep and cardiovascular health among LGBTQ+ adults, and 2) compare various unsupervised learning techniques on their performance on clustering sleep patterns using actigraphy data. We have multiple datasets for conducting our analyses to delineate the pattern of associations between sleep and other variables. We will also explore various modeling techniques to quantify the within- and between-person variability in sleep patterns. We aim to complete multiple analyses in the Fall and Spring semesters to develop conference abstracts and manuscripts to be submitted in Spring 2022. Since our DSI seed grant is still ongoing, during the Fall semester the Scholar will work on data wrangling and analyses, in addition to data management from existing data collected from our Precision in Symptom Self-Management pilot studies. In January 2022, we will begin analyzing data from our DSI seed grant. We hope to collaborate with a student who is interested in machine learning, sleep, and/or health disparities. The Scholar will have the opportunity to contribute to all of these aspects of the project. The Scholar will also be able to propose and lead additional analyses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We study how competing groups of regulators regulate the COI disclosure using the setting of the fairness opinion (“FO”) providers in mergers and acquisitions (“M&amp;amp;A”). In this setting, there are three types of regulators with cross-sectional variation in enforcement: the SEC, FINRA, and state courts. Though each group regulates the same disclosure, they all have authority over different regulatees: The SEC has authority over the managers who create the filings; FINRA has authority over the FO providers; and state courts have authority over the board of directors. We examine the effectiveness of each group’s enforcement and the effect of their interactions on COI disclosures. Our paper contributes to the literature on regulatory design for financial reporting disclosures, especially when the different regulatees need to coordinate information or when disclosures have negative implications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://cu-dsi-scholars.github.io/DSI-scholars/2021/09/project-impacts-of-flood-risk-on-socio-economic-characteristics-of-coastal-neighborhoods/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The project is analyzing how flood risk affects the composition of coastal neighborhoods. Understanding the effects of flooding on residential mobility and livelihoods is important for designing policies that support equitable adaptation to coastal flooding, addressing inequities in the impacts of flooding. Increasing flood risk may lead to gentrification as wealthier homeowners who have the resources to defend their homes against rising waters displace lower income households in waterfront locations, or coastal neighborhoods may deteriorate if flood-prone real estate loses value and/or economic activity and incomes decline. The study focuses on the effect of flooding associated with Hurricane Sandy on the composition of coastal neighborhoods in New York and New Jersey. The study will use panel data from the American Community Survey from 2010 to 2020 and data on flooding due to Sandy to compare the change in neighborhood characteristics such as income distribution, education, race, gender, and age over time in locations that were affected by Sandy and similar communities that were not. Dr. Malgosia Madajewicz will mentor the scholar, meeting at least once a week in person or virtually, and more often if needed. She will communicate with the scholar by email and phone as often as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the effects of environmental exposures on child health and development is crucial to promote positive health outcomes in adulthood. To advance knowledge in this area, our lab is part of the NIH-funded Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Program. As of April 2021, the cohorts have collected data from over 90,000 participants which includes over 57,000 children. The selected student(s) will be involved in projects investigating the relationship between a variety of prenatal and postnatal exposures and physiological variables. Specifically, we aim to build multidimensional associative and predictive models to investigate the effects of prenatal maternal drinking and smoking on development of cardiac and neural systems non-invasively assessed at 4-, 5-, 7-, 9- and 11-years of age. We will advance prior work on the relationship of maternal depression and child development by including depression measures at 1 and 4 years post-delivery and prospective assessment of multiple domains of child development and applying machine learning methods for trajectory identification.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Business email compromise (BEC) is a prevalent cyber attack, where the attacker impersonates a figure of authority or legitimacy (e.g., the CEO, a business associate), and asks the target to wire money to a bank account by the attacker. Based on FBI estimates, in the past several years, attackers have been able to steal over $22B in fraudulent wire transfers. Such attacks have affected a very wide range of individuals and institutions, from the world&amp;rsquo;s largest and most sophisticated companies (e.g., Google, Facebook), to government and public entities, and even individuals whose house down payment was stolen by an attacker pretending to be their mortgage broker.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease of the artery wall, is the underlying cause of human coronary heart diseases. Single-cell genomics have catalyzed the revolution in understanding of cellular heterogeneity and dynamics in atherosclerotic vasculature. The goal of the project is to leverage published and our own single-cell genomic data and perform a meta-analysis. Meta-analysis allows integrated analysis of much larger cell numbers and helps resolve the full spectrum of cellular heterogeneity and dynamics in atherosclerotic vessels and facilitate therapeutic translation. The DSI scholar will: (1) use the latest bioinformatic pipeline to integrate the existing scRNA-seq, CITE-seq, and scATAC-seq datasets; (2) analyze the integrated datasets using R/Bioconductor packages (e.g. Seurat); (3) interpret the data using pathway and network analysis. Some relevant workflows are available through the &amp;ldquo;Resources&amp;rdquo; page of our lab website at &lt;a href=&#34;https://hanruizhang.github.io/zhanglab/&#34;&gt;https://hanruizhang.github.io/zhanglab/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the structure and function of the human gut microbiome is expected to revolutionize healthcare due to its many associations with human disease. A critical step in microbiome analysis involves a clustering stage, where genomic sequences of unknown origin are assigned to latent genomes present in the sample. Current clustering methods rely on mixture-models, yet these fail to correctly model the features of genomic sequences shared across multiple genomes. These sequences are of great importance, often encoding antibiotic resistance genes that drive resistant outbreaks. This project&amp;rsquo;s goal is to develop a clustering algorithm that will effectively cluster both shared and unique genomic sequences. We have developed two probabilistic models, both based around hierarchical Poisson factorization, that have already produced promising results. The project&amp;rsquo;s goal will be to refine these models: This will involve robustly evaluating the current models, determining their limitations, and designing new models that improve upon the current. A successful project will enable for the first time, scalable, and comprehensive reconstruction of bacterial genomes. In turn, this will enable a large-scale analysis of antimicrobial resistance in the context of the human gut microbiome. We anticipate a successful project to result in an exciting publication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project is to evaluate algorithms that predict gene expression directly from sequencing data. With the availability of large scale sequencing data in ADSP and progress made in machine learning methods, it is possible to model long range interactions in the DNA sequence to infer intermediate phenotypes such as gene expression. First, we will test a deep learning based method called Enformer that is able to integrate long-range interactions (such as promoter-enhancer interactions) in the genome and predict gene expression from sequence. Using available RNA-sequencing on a small number of samples (e.g. ROSMAP cohort), we will optimize the algorithm to improve accuracy of prediction. Secondly, inferred expression in the ADSP cohorts will be used to test association with Alzheimer’s Disease and related endophenotypes. Finally, we will incorporate datasets that will become available in future such as cell-type specific ATAC-seq and disease-specific gene expression to re-train learning models to improve gene-expression prediction directly from sequencing data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Computational methods for identifying protein coding genes can leverage the conserved translational mapping of triplet codons to amino acids. However, non-coding genes, that are transcribed into RNAs but do not code for proteins, lack this structure, hindering their identification. Deep neural networks have shown tremendous promise in learning useful representations of unstructured data, including genomic data. Our lab is investigating the application of deep learning and natural language processing to the learning of representations useful for non-coding gene identification in bacterial genomes. We are seeking a student to contribute to this work. The goals of this project include 1) the identification and application of neural network architectures useful for identifying different classes of non-coding RNAs, 2) the interrogation of well-performing models in order to identify features of non-coding RNAs, and 3) the design of robust test cases which enable the comparison of these novel methods to existing methods for non-coding RNA identification in bacterial genomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project aims to use data science with historical version of startup websites to identify when do they pivot to new strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firm strategies—what they choose to to do or not to do, and why—represent the main way in which firms shape the economy. In a time of widely encompassing platforms, corporate-led crypto currencies, activist CEOs, and socially-oriented corporations, characterizing how firms differ in their strategies, and in the choices they take, appears as important as ever. There is a need for tools to measure firm strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a student scholar, your role in this position would be to work in the nascent Measuring Strategy Lab, using natural language processing methods to devise new ways to understand and measure firm strategy.  Specifically, using a large sample of startup websites downloaded through the Wayback Machine, develop systematic ways to understand when a startup is changing their strategy and why, and how does this predict their performance.  This work builds also on the Startup Cartography Project, and is part of the ongoing efforts of bringing data science into strategy research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many scholars and policymakers view establishing functioning data markets as essential for the digital economy to bring prosperity and stability to society at large. A key challenge is to determine the value of an individual&amp;rsquo;s specific data. Is one buyer’s data more valuable than another’s for an e-commerce platform? How much should each be paid?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This research project aims at exploring and developing methods to improve and diversify the visualizations of the interactions between the Internet and the topographical and geopolitical space (i.e. space and the political actors that rule over it) through the case study of a region of interest (could be virtually any region that would be of interest for the student). The main intend of the project is to produce a set of maps and visualizations (including infographics where relevant), as comprehensive and diverse as possible, combining Internet mapping with the geographical and geopolitical context of that region. We will build on top of existing techniques for visualizations of the Internet and discuss potential capacities to further model the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;All volcanoes on earth are driven by the degassing of volatile elements, mostly H2O and CO2 from their host magma. To model the degassing process, one needs to know the solubility laws of these volatile. To that end, petrologists have been performing high-pressure high-temperature experiments for sixty years to determine how much water and CO2 dissolves in magma as a function of Pressure, Temperature, Melt composition (12 oxides) and oxidation state. To model how these fifteen parameters affect solubility laws petrologist have then relied on empirical interpolation between experimental data points and some extrapolations using classical thermodynamic theory to infer the expected behavior beyond experimental calibration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;call-for-faculty-participation-fall-2021&#34;&gt;Call for Faculty Participation. Fall 2021.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Data Science Institute is calling for faculty submissions of research projects for the pring and/or summer 2021 sessions of the Data Science Institute (DSI) Scholars Program. The goal of the DSI Scholars Program is to engage undergraduate and master students to work with Columbia faculty, through the creation of data science research internships. Last year, we worked with 38 projects and received more than 400 unique applications from Columbia Students. The program&amp;rsquo;s unique enrichment activities foster a learning and collaborative community in data science at Columbia. Apply &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQNPZYgxVAcJyaoWUPmJA1WtMYrFEh8bBiG_LNeGSwWYHmhw/viewform&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Genome wide CRISPR lethality screens show broad variability in cellular fitness phenotypes across cancer. We postulate that genes with overlapping functions should deliver similar responses enabling functional annotation of uncharacterized genes. Here we will build a network connecting genes based on the similarity of their knockout phenotypes, benchmark this network using protein interaction databases and functional  transcriptomics, and leverage network analyses to identify mutational and transcriptional modulators of functional complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A wealth of evidence for the automaticity of perceptual organization processes points toward the existence of a global-to-local processing bias in early perceptual stages. Global features are encoded and spontaneously reported during early conscious vision, resulting in the perception of coherent objects prior to identifying detailed information. Yet, results from experiments that presented illusory figure presentation below the perceptual threshold to study the reliance of perceptual organization on visual awareness have shown conflicting findings, leaving open the question of how global features interact during figure perception. The present study will examine the interaction between symmetry and perceptual completion under conditions of restricted awareness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project has a two-fold aim. First, we seek to determine what makes an idea seem novel versus ordinary and if there is an ideal mix of the two. Second, building on these findings, we build a generative model that suggests tweaks to an idea that enhance its perceived creativity and appeal. We will pursue these two aims using 69K recipes and reviews from allrecipes.com. We will use NLP approach to extract important features from the recipe such as ingredients, preparation instruction and review content.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Using a validated survey called the Digital IT Maturity Survey, the team is conducting a three-wave, longitudinal, repeated measures survey in a national sample of NHs. Currently, in year 2 of recruitment and analyzing year 1 data. Methods include an examination of the relationships between NH IT Maturity and stages of maturity, and nationally-reported, publicly-available NH Quality Measures available through Nursing Home Compare over three consecutive years. Specific aims are: 1) Explore NH IT maturity using the survey and staging model during a 3-year national assessment 2) Examine if NH IT maturity is associated with CMS quality measures in a national sample of NHs over 3 years. This study includes a survey of NH IT Maturity in a nationally representative sample including 10% of NHs recruited from each state in the United States (N=1,570). Statistical analysis will be done using the software SAS v9 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Since the sampling method involves stratification by state and since the sampling weights assigned to homes will depend on the number of respondents within each state, the analysis must take the complex sampling design into account. SAS procedures including SURVEYMEANS, SURVEYFREQ, SURVEYLOGISTIC, and SURVEYREG will be used for such analyses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prediction Markets have been used to forecasts outcomes of research interest using market mechanism (See &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/news/the-power-of-prediction-markets-1.20820)&#34;&gt;https://www.nature.com/news/the-power-of-prediction-markets-1.20820)&lt;/a&gt;. A decentralized prediction market, Augur, has been created on blockchain for betting purposes (See, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.augur.net/)&#34;&gt;https://www.augur.net/)&lt;/a&gt;. An alternative approach to prediction market has been proposed in Dalal et al (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040162511000734)&#34;&gt;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040162511000734)&lt;/a&gt;.  This project proposes to develop a new model for decentralized prediction market which can be used to elicit opinions of university researchers on socially important issues. Specifically, the project will use Ethereum based platform to develop a smart contract and an ERC-20 compliant token for researchers to participate in the new market.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The federal government spends billions of dollars a year supporting rural broadband (internet access), subsidizing build-out in low-density areas that do not have broadband (unserved areas). However, it is not clear whether the rural areas most in need are receiving a fair share of the funding. Using a very large dataset of broadband availability, census data and recent auction results, the project will analyze whether unserved areas with high racial diversity or lower median income are receiving a fair share of funding. Depending on team size, we will also attempt to create a shareable master data set building on OpenStreetMap and other sources that provides key data points for census units.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Water joined gold, oil and other commodities traded on Wall Street, highlighting worries that the life-sustaining natural resource may become scarce across more of the world. In the state of California, the biggest U.S. agriculture market and world&amp;rsquo;s fifth-largest economy, this challenge is particularly prevalent. Farmers, hedge funds and municipalities are now able to prepare for the risk that future water availability issues can bring in the state of California.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in genomic technologies have led to the identification of many novel disease-gene associations, enabling more precise diagnoses. Along with the technologies enabling rapid DNA sequencing, multiple computational approaches have been developed to identify structural variants (i.e. relatively large deletions and duplications of genomic sequences). These workflows can lead to the identification of different structural variants, raising the risk of missing disease-causing variants when using only one of those methods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the explosive growth of medical literature, making sense of medical evidence is harder than ever. The free text form also makes it difficult to perform evidence retrieval of appraisal. There is a great need for tools and methods that can structure and reason over medical evidence. The goal of this project is to develop computational and symbolic methods to extract evidence from PubMed abstracts, integrate it with evidence derived from real world clinical data (or practice-based evidence), and perform automated knowledge discovery and evidence reasoning. We also hope this research can support evidence-based medicine during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide opportunities for students to hone his/her skills on natural language processing, data mining, deep learning, and semantic knowledge engineering. We have solid preliminary results for the students to build upon. An open-source PICO parser that extracts Population, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome information from PubMed abstracts has been developed and published. Current COVID-19 literature has been downloaded from PubMed and been pre-processed. Preliminary analyses are under way to investigate the patterns in the study populations in COVID-19 clinical studies. Our next steps include but are not limited to evidence summarization at the study level and evidence reasoning at the problem/topic level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Retaining walls are structures designed to restrain soil to a slope that it would not naturally keep to.
They were used to facilitate the city’s development in hilly areas. Students may be familiar with the
Morningside Park retaining wall , present immediately East of the Columbia campus. Retaining walls
facing streets are mapped and inspected. Not so retaining walls supporting soil at back yards. Because
the NYC Building Department is not aware of the presence of most, they are not inspected and left to
decay. A fatal collapse occurred in October 2020.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;New York State regulates construction and demolition waste (CDW)—its generation, recycling and reuse—and collects all data on CDW from private waste haulers and transfer stations/recycling facilities. There is no city source of data for CDW. For the city to innovate policy with respect to CDW, which is a source of embedded carbon, by leveraging its capital program to close material loops, generating environmental sustainability and financial sustainability benefits, it is important to understand where CDW goes after the demolition process through the transfer and recycling processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Decoding behavioral signifiers for the brain state of vigilance can have far reaching implications for understanding actions and identifying disease. We are using high resolution video recordings of mice as they navigate a maze, but have access to very few pre-determined behavioral signifiers. Several recent publications implemented computer vision to extract a variety of previously unreachable aspects of behavioral analysis, including animal pose estimation and distinguishable internal states. These descriptions allowed for the identification and characterization of dynamics, which then revealed an unprecedented richness to the behaviors that determine decision making. Applying such computational approaches in our maze in the context of behaviors that have been validated to measure choice and memory can reveal dimensions of behavior that predict or even determine psychological constructs like vigilance. DSI scholars would use pose estimation analysis to evaluate behavioral signifiers for choice and memory and relate it to our real time concurrent measures of neural activity and transmitter release.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are conducting a study at the Columbia School of Social Work to examine associations between adolescent mental health and physiological data (collected through smart watches), sociability metrics (e.g., number of texts, amount of time on social media platforms) and self-reported daily stressors (collected through mobile surveys) and use this data to inform the development of a just-in-time adaptive intervention (delivered by smartphone) to reduce mental health problems among adolescents. Just-in-time adaptive interventions aim to provide the right type/amount of support, at the right time, by adapting to an individual&amp;rsquo;s changing internal and contextual state. We are looking for a student(s) to develop a mobile app (Android and iOS compatible) that has the following capabilities:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the industrial revolution the atmosphere has continued to warm due to an accumulation of carbon. Terrestrial ecosystems play a crucial role in quelling the effects of climate change by storing atmospheric carbon in biomass and in the soils. In order to inform carbon reduction policy an accurate quantification of land-air carbon fluxes is necessary. To quantify the terrestrial CO2 exchange, direct monitoring of surface carbon fluxes at few locations across the globe provide valuable observations. However, this data is sparse in both space and time, and is thus unable to provide an estimate of the global spatiotemporal changes, as well as rare extreme conditions (droughts, heatwaves). In this project we will first use synthetic data and sample CO2 fluxes from a simulation of the Earth system at observation locations and then use various machine learning algorithms (neural networks, boosting, GANs) to reconstruct the model&amp;rsquo;s CO2 flux at all locations. We will then evaluate the performance of each method using a suite of regression metrics. Finally, time permitting, we will apply these methods to real observations. This project provides a way of evaluating the performance of machine learning methods as they are used in Earth science.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease of the artery wall, is the underlying cause of human coronary heart diseases. Single-cell genomics have catalyzed the revolution in understanding of cellular heterogeneity and dynamics in atherosclerotic vasculature. The goal of the project is to leverage published and our own single-cell genomic data and perform a meta-analysis. Meta-analysis allows integrated analysis of much larger cell numbers and helps resolve the full spectrum of cellular heterogeneity and dynamics in atherosclerotic vessels and facilitate therapeutic translation. The DSI scholar will: (1) use the latest bioinformatic pipeline to integrate the existing scRNA-seq, CITE-seq, and scATAC-seq datasets; (2) analyze the integrated datasets using R/Bioconductor packages (e.g. Seurat); (3) interpret the data using pathway and network analysis. Some relevant workflows are available through the &amp;ldquo;Resources&amp;rdquo; page of our lab website at &lt;a href=&#34;https://hanruizhang.github.io/zhanglab/&#34;&gt;https://hanruizhang.github.io/zhanglab/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;5G cellular networks will use high-frequency millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication, which promises high data rates and ample spectrum availability. Students working on this project will help conduct a mmWave wireless channel measurement campaign around the COSMOS testbed (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cosmos-lab.org&#34;&gt;www.cosmos-lab.org&lt;/a&gt;), a wireless networking testbed located at Columbia stretching between 120th and 136th St. In collaboration with Bell Labs students will be able to use unique, state-of-the-art mmWave equipment to conduct these measurements (see pre-pandemic example in &lt;a href=&#34;https://wimnet.ee.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/mmNets2019_COSMOS_28GHz.pdf)&#34;&gt;https://wimnet.ee.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/mmNets2019_COSMOS_28GHz.pdf)&lt;/a&gt;. The measurements will play an important role in the development of network-level control algorithms, which is the other, more analytical side of this research project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The CONCERN project aims to develop models and tools to quantify clinician concern about patient deterioration in the inpatient setting that can be used in early warning scores.  We have discovered and validated several measurable ways within the Electronic Health Record (EHR) to measure clinician concern and have demonstrated that our approach identified patients at risk of deterioration earlier than other methods, which focus only on physiological data.  One of our approaches is leveraging documentation of certain concepts within narrative text in nursing notes that are consistent with concern about a patient. However, this narrative free text is not easily accessible - it is often mixed together with structured or templated text and varies over note types. The steps to be performed are&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chronic exposure to arsenic (As) in groundwater is a staggering global public health crisis and yet, we lack a complete understanding of the environmental conditions that govern As mobility and toxicity in groundwater and are unable predict groundwater As concentrations with enough confidence to make effective management decisions. The objective of this project is to identify key hydrologic and biogeochemical variables that control groundwater As concentrations and heterogeneity across spatial scales in Southeast Asia and the USA. We then aim to develop clear mechanistic linkages and high-resolution geospatial information that can be used with machine learning to evaluate and predict groundwater As contamination. This project involves the integration of various types of large datasets from remotely-sensed and field-collected measurements (e.g., surface hydrology and topography, groundwater geochemistry, climate, and population density). We are looking for a student to advance the connections between key environmental variables and groundwater As contamination across scales. The student will receive experience and mentorship in cutting-edge research that crosses interdisciplinary fields, and will have the opportunity to lead their own project and acquire analytical skills using creative measures, which can involve remote sensing, geospatial methods, statistics and graphing, machine learning, and predictive modeling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The ocean significantly mitigates climate change by absorbing fossil fuel carbon from the atmosphere. Cumulatively since the preindustrial times, the ocean has absorbed 40% of emissions. To understand past changes, diagnose ongoing changes, and to predict the future behavior of the ocean carbon sink, we must understand its spatial and temporal variability. However, the ocean is poorly sampled and so we cannot do this directly from in situ measurements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Air quality is a major crisis globally, leading to about 5 million premature deaths every year. In sub-Saharan Africa, there is little air pollution data available to characterize the problem, and a lack of focus on solutions. Using output from a high spatiotemporal resolution atmospheric chemistry transport model over Africa simulated by Dr. Westervelt and his group, the student will characterize levels of pollution and validate model results by comparing observed data to model output. The student will also analyze results from sensitivity simulations in which sources of air pollution have been artificially &amp;ldquo;turned off&amp;rdquo; in the model. Comparison between the two simulations will allow for source attribution of air pollution, which is important for developing satisfactory mitigation strategies to improve air quality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project is to collect anonymized traces from the Columbia network in order to analyze video traffic characteristics during the work/study-from home period. This information will be used for developing various ML-based tools for Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement. We will perform the feature extraction at the collection time itself and use anonymization techniques (e.g., IP address anonymization), to preserve user privacy. Students will analyze/measure encrypted network traffic to provide ground truth for potential RL/ML algorithms for estimating video QoE and identifying device/application (e.g., the start of a video streaming session). These algorithms can serve as a basis for new video adaptation techniques (see for example - &lt;a href=&#34;https://wimnet.ee.columbia.edu/wimnet-team-wins-3rd-place-in-the-acm-mmsys20-twitch-grand-challenge/&#34;&gt;https://wimnet.ee.columbia.edu/wimnet-team-wins-3rd-place-in-the-acm-mmsys20-twitch-grand-challenge/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project is to study the molecular background of various congenital disorders affecting the cranial nerves, which are important in senses (hearing, vision, smell), facial muscle movements and more. Abnormal cranial nerve development can cause hearing loss, eye-movement disorders, facial weakness, loss of smell, and difficulties with respiration and swallowing. Some individuals may also have other motor, sensory, intellectual, behavioral and social disabilities. These disorders cause significant disability and are caused by genetic variants, often novel variation or de novo. Unfortunately, disorders affecting the 8th cranial nerve or vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII), important in hearing and balance, have been largely understudied. As various cranial nerves can be affected together, such as in Moebius syndrome, and as the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) and facial nerve (CN VII) also share a path in the internal auditory canal, it is likely that these disorders share underlying genes or closely interacting genes. To investigate the genetic architecture of cranial nerve abnormalities we suggest to molecularly investigate an in-house CN VIII cohort and other cranial dysinnervation cohorts. We will study rare genomic variants (both small variant as structural variants) to identify shared molecular pathways and genes amongst individuals with cranial dysinnervation disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Health care professionals cannot examine every person calling the office with a question nor can they return every call. Therefore, medical offices seeking to improve the speed and efficiency of evaluating and triaging patients must utilize telephone personnel who are often non-clinical staff. These telephone triage personnel may be limited in their knowledge and ability to obtain the necessary details of the patient&amp;rsquo;s medical symptoms and direct medical care accordingly. Their role is not to make diagnoses by phone, but rather to collect sufficient data related to the patient’s complaints and assign them appropriately in order to get the patient to the right level of care with the right provider in the right place at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Future wireless networks will use high-frequency millimeter-wave (mmWave) links for transmitting and receiving information with high throughput. A key difference between mmWave links and conventional sub-6GHz links is that mmWave links are severely affected by weather conditions. Students working on this project will use a state-of-the-art mmWave radar to assess the impact of wind speed, temperature, humidity, and other factors on the high-frequency link. The end goal of the project is to develop a classifier that can infer weather conditions based on the signal received from the mmWave radar. In this project, students are expected to learn how the mmWave radar works, design experiments to obtain labeled data, perform measurements, and develop the classifier.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Columbia University &lt;a href=&#34;http://datascience.columbia.edu/&#34;&gt;Data Science Institute&lt;/a&gt; is pleased to announce that the Data Science Institute (DSI) and Data For Good Scholars programs for Fall 2020 are open for application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the DSI Scholars Program is to engage Columbia University&amp;rsquo;s undergraduate and master&amp;rsquo;s students in data science research with Columbia faculty through a research internship. The program connects students with research projects across Columbia and provides student researchers with an additional learning experience and networking opportunities. Through unique enrichment activities, this program aims to foster a learning and collaborative community in data science at Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Data For Good Scholars program connects student volunteers to organizations and individuals working for the social good whose projects have developed a need for data science expertise. As &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo; problems with real world data, these projects are excellent opportunities for students to learn how data science is practiced outside of the university setting and to learn how to work effectively with people for whom data science sits outside of their subject area.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Immune checkpoint blockade therapy has shown successful clinical outcomes in the treatment of  various solid tumors such as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and others. However, immune checkpoint inhibitors work best in patients who exhibit certain tumor biomarkers. In a collaboration with the Department of Hematology Oncology, the Department of Systems Biology, and the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University we aim to identify biomarkers which are associated with treatment outcome in patients with solid tumors who underwent immunotherapy. The project includes bioinformatic analysis of sequencing data. Mentoring and training will be provided.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Freshwater supply is critical for managing and meeting human and ecological demands. However, while stocks of water in both natural and artificial reservoirs are helpful for increasing availability, droughts and floods, as well as whiplash events affect reliability on these systems, posing grave consequences on water users. This risk is particularly salient in the state of California, where many local communities have been plagued by extreme hydrological events. In this current research, we contribute to California&amp;rsquo;s Water Data Challenge effort where a diverse group of volunteers convened to form a multi-disciplinary team that addresses the crucial issues of extreme events in California using data science approaches. Members include researchers and professionals who come from a range of backgrounds representing academia and private sectors. We combine a range of publicly available datasets with Machine Learning (ML) techniques to explore predictability of extreme events during California’s water years. More specifically, we use a variety of water districts and showcase how ML prediction models are not only able to predict the flow of water at varying time horizons, they capture uncertainties posed by the climate and human influences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Electronic Health Records (EHR) provide a rich integrated source of phenotypic information that allow for automated extraction and recognition of phenotypes from EHR narratives and provide an efficient framework for conducting epidemiological and clinical studies.  In addition, when EHR are linked to genetic data in electronic biorepositories such as eMERGE and All of US, phenotype information embedded in EHR can be used to efficiently construct cohorts powered for genetic discoveries. However, limitations arise from repurposing data generated from healthcare processes for research, which can include data sparseness, low quality data and diagnostic errors. Phenotyping algorithms are developed to overcome these limitations providing a robust means to assess case status.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;New York Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center (NYP/CUIMC) serves a high number of racial/ethnic minority and low-income patients. In this project, we will create a data repository of all patients who have completed a universal screen in a clinical encounter for social determinants of health, including food insecurity. The scholar will handle large datasets extracted from the medical record for database creation and data visualizations. The dataset will include patient demographics, food security, and clinical outcomes. This data resource will allow the scholar to partner with researchers to examine predictors of food insecurity, clinical courses, and health outcomes among a large population of patients, including a time period prior to the COVID-19 surge in New York City.  The project will be co-mentored through the members of the University-wide Food Systems Network, a novel collaboration of researchers at the Medical Center, Earth Institute, SIPA, and Teacher&amp;rsquo;s College.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Getting a better approximation of the age of a NYC’s building can improve assigning the building to a structural type that includes type of construction and relevant building code in effect. Mapping the age and type of building would help NYC DOB and the City on a number of fronts, which include enabling NYC DOB to be more effective in enforcing  building and construction safety and evaluating risk when adjacent or nearby subsurface construction is proposed. Furthermore, the more precise characterization of NYC buildings will improve efforts by the City to craft policies aimed at energy efficiency (TWG) as it drives to 80% GHG reductions by 2050 (80X50) and determining natural disaster vulnerability of its building stock (HAZUS).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The State regulates Construction and Demolition Waste (CDW) — its generation, recycling and reuse — and collects all data on CDW.  There is no city source of data for CDW.  For the city to innovate policy with respect to CDW by leveraging its capital program as one way to close material loops, which would generate environmental sustainability and financial sustainability benefits, understanding where CDW goes from the demolition process through the recycling process is the most important single step.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Memory is a basic function of our brain that enables us to use the past experiences to service the present and future on a daily base, and memory function is often disrupted in neurological and psychiatric diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease and posttraumatic stress disorder. To understand the molecular mechanism of memory storage, we will focus on DNA methylation, a chemical modification of our genome, that is hypothesized to play a critical role for memory. We have identified thousands of DNA methylation changes at numerous genomic loci occurred during the formation of fear and reward memory in the mouse brain. We will develop new computational tools to analyze these changes of DNA methylation and search for the common sequence features of these genomic loci. The result of this project will lead to a systematic understanding of the principle on the function and regulation of DNA methylation in memory, and will pave the way to develop new therapeutic strategies for diseases involved memory defects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Complex microbial communities play an important role in numerous fields, from human health to bioremediation. One critical challenge in their data analysis is to separate true biological data from contamination of various sources. While contemporary experimental procedures include various negative controls, a comprehensive statistical approach for their analysis has not been developed. Such a framework would have a far-reaching impact on the field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Complex microbiomes play an important role in numerous fields. One critical challenge in their data analysis is to separate true biological data from contamination. Contemporary experimental procedures include negative controls from various sources, but their analysis is complicated by “well-to-well” contamination: contamination that associates with the position of samples during experimental procedures. This causes bacteria sampled from a true biological source to appear in nearby control samples, and vice versa. An analytic approach that accounts for this source of contamination would have a far-reaching impact on the field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our lab is interested in aneuploidy, or the incorrect number of whole chromosomes and chromosome arms. A challenge in this area of research is that karyotypes require a large number of proliferating cells for analysis. To address this, our lab and collaborators developed new algorithms to identify aneuploidy alterations from DNA sequencing data. Here, the project goal is to implement these algorithms at Columbia, and subsequently to apply these analysis methods to samples generated in the lab and patient samples. Building on this, the DSI student may also develop new algorithms for use with single-cell sequencing data and RNA sequencing data. Experience in one or more of the following is a must: UNIX, R, and python. The DSI student will be mentored by Dr. Alison Taylor, and he/she will also work closely with all lab members.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the interaction between human-associated microbial communities and human health is expected to revolutionize healthcare. Recent work found that this interaction is, in part, shaped by genetic differences between otherwise identical species in the microbiome. Detecting this variation, however, is a significant challenge. This project aims to profile microbial genetic variation within and across multiple patients&#39; microbiomes. This will allow us to better compare and interpret this variation in the context of human disease, gaining mechanistic insight into complex human-microbiome interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project will focus on the identification of genetic factors involved in various forms of hereditary diseases, including neurodevelopmental disorders, hearing loss, skeletal disorders and more. Some of these children endure years-long diagnostic odysseys of trial-and-error testing with inconclusive results and misdirected treatments. We are dedicated to track down their molecular causes by integrating various “-omics” technologies, including genomics, transcriptomics and epigenomics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://cu-dsi-scholars.github.io/DSI-scholars/2020/09/project-improving-observed-and-modeled-air-pollution-data-quality-over-sub-saharan-africa-using-machine-learning/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of the project is twofold: 1) to better understand and further improve the use of low cost air pollution sensors and 2) to analyze and characterize air pollution data in sub-Saharan Africa. Air pollution kills an estimated 700,000 people per year in Africa, but existing air pollution data in Africa is extremely sparse and estimates of the associated mortality are uncertain. Low cost air pollution sensors have the potential to rapidly revolutionize air quality awareness and data availability in data-sparse areas of  the world, including sub-Saharan Africa. However, use of low cost sensors requires careful calibration, performance evaluation, and other quality assurance before the data can be fully trusted to the same degree as regulatory-grade monitors. As part of a larger project led by Dr. Westervelt, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) sensors have already been deployed in several African megacities, including Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo; Nairobi, Kenya; Kampala, Uganda; Accra, Ghana, and Lomé, Togo. In Kampala and Accra, sensors are co-located with a regulatory-grade PM2.5 instrument for several months, allowing for a direct comparison between low cost and regulatory-grade PM2.5 measurements, and also allowing for the development of calibration factors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project works with a novel corpus of text-based school data to develop a multi-dimensional measure of the degree to which American colleges and universities offer a liberal arts education. We seek a data scientist for various tasks on a project that uses analysis of multiple text corpora to better understand the liberal arts. This is an ongoing three-year project with opportunities for future collaborations, academic publications, and developing and improving existing data science and machine learning skills. Tasks likely include: (1) Using Amazon Web Services to create and maintain cloud-based storage (SQL, S3 buckets) of the project&amp;rsquo;s expanding library of data. (2) Extracting information (named entities, times, places, books, and so on) from millions of plain-text syllabus records. (3) Merging multiple forms of data into a single dataset. (4) Scraping websites for relevant information (e.g., college course offerings, school rankings). Some pages may include dynamically created content that requires the use of a program such as Selenium.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The spread of COVID-19 has led to unprecedented and ongoing changes to daily life, including shelter-in-place orders, widespread closing of businesses and schools, and work-from-home and school-from-home at previously unknown levels. These changes in behavior are placing extraordinary demands on the Internet. This project will measure the Internet’s ability to meet these demands, including comparing its performance before, during, and after the peak of COVID-19; whether the amount of change varies between areas heavily impacted by COVID-19 and those less impacted; and whether and how large networks adapt. To provide this rich understanding, this project will combine multiple Internet-scale datasets that provide complementary views to investigate how responses to COVID-19 have impacted the Internet and how networks have reacted. Measuring the network impact of COVID-19 will illuminate the Internet’s strengths and weak points and is a crucial step towards improving the Internet’s future resilience in the face of pandemics, natural disasters, large scale conflict, and terrorist attacks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, these types of data are routinely neglected in hand-crafted constitutive models due to the complexity. Instead, descriptors such as void fraction, dislocation density, and other statistical measures of the microstructures are often incorporated into yield surface or hardening rules (e.g. Gurson damage model, critical state plasticity). In this work, we will overcome this technical barrier by using a deep convolutional neural network to deduce low-dimensional descriptors that best describes the physics of the deformation process of polycrystals. With deep Q reinforcement learning to automate the trial-and-error process, we may explore the decision tree with a large number of trials that are impossible to be done manually. This treatment will empower us to discover the underlying mechanics of polycrystals under a variety of pressure, temperature, and loading rates highly relevant to the Air Force applications. While previous work on data-driven models has often focused on complete substitutions of constitutive laws with a data-driven paradigm, I intend to seek the best option representing the hierarchy of material responses, while implementing adversarial attacks to determine hidden weaknesses of existing polycrystal plasticity models as well as the one generated from the ML approaches. I will make use of a collocation Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) solver to speed up the generations of the material database, digesting microstructural data via descriptors in the non-Euclidean space, Graph-based knowledge abstraction, and adversarial attack.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The human microbiome is associated with different diseases, but the metabolic mechanisms through which it can modulate health are mostly unknown. Understanding these mechanisms is of paramount importance for prevention and treatment. While metagenomics analysis provides associations between microbial presence and specific diseases, metabolomics analysis can highlight metabolic alterations. None of the two, however, can unveil microbiome metabolic mechanisms associated with these detected alterations. In an attempt to fill this knowledge gap, several microbiome metabolic modeling methods were recently developed. An accurate evaluation of the accuracy of such methods in relation to different pathologies and microbiomes was never conducted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The main goal of this work is to assess if storms have increased in frequency over Antarctica. It is theorized that climate change will increase the intensity of the winds and frequency of the storms. With ICESat 2 satellite laser altimetry, we can count the number of storms and blowing snow events. ICESat 2 is a photon counting laser and generates terrabytes of data each day. Innovative data science techniques are needed to handle the data and analyze it. This project is, therefore, a suitable topic for a masters student that combines an important problem in Geophysics and climate science with a great Data Science application.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Until today there is no comprehensive theory for formation of tropical cyclones (hurricanes, typhoons). Therefore, it is common to use statistical methods to derive empirical indices as proxies for the probability for genesis. There are also different types of genesis pathways that have been explored in ad-hoc manner. I would like to explore the possibility of using machine learning to explore tropical cyclone genesis, in particular the different pathways in a more comprehensive manner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The proposed project would focus on analyzing quantitative data from a 4 year NIMH-funded study entitled &amp;ldquo;Integrating evidence-based  depression treatment in primary care: Tuberculosis (TB) in Brazil as a model&amp;rdquo; (PI: Sweetland, K01MH104514). The aim of the study was to assess whether social network analysis could be used to leverage the receptivity and connectivity of TB providers in a Brazilian public health system in a way that could accelerate the adoption (implementation) and diffusion (dissemination) of an evidence-based treatment for depression treatment in a primary care network. Baseline receptivity was operationalized via six brief quantitative scales to measure mental health literacy, work self-efficacy, organizational climate, attitudes towards evidence-based practices, organizational readiness to change and individual innovation thresholds. Connectivity was assessed by asking TB providers with whom they discuss difficult cases, give advice to, or receive advice regarding difficult TB cases. Baseline receptivity and connectivity data was used to identify 3 pilot sites in which to train primary care providers to deliver evidence-based depression treatment for one year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Given the COVID-19 environment and the increasing requests for additional support for projects, the Data Science Institute is pleased to announce a second wave of summer research projects through the Data Science Scholars and Data For Good programs. Please note that this is on a compressed timeline and student applications are due &lt;strong&gt;Sunday, May 24th&lt;/strong&gt;, 2020 at &lt;strong&gt;11:59pm&lt;/strong&gt; Eastern time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the DSI Scholars Program is to engage Columbia University&amp;rsquo;s undergraduate and master&amp;rsquo;s students in data science research with Columbia faculty through a research internship. The program connects students with research projects across Columbia and provides student researchers with an additional learning experience and networking opportunities. Through unique enrichment activities, this program aims to foster a learning and collaborative community in data science at Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Data For Good Scholars program connects student volunteers to organizations and individuals working for the social good whose projects have developed a need for data science expertise. As &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo; problems with real world data, these projects are excellent opportunities for students to learn how data science is practiced outside of the university setting and to learn how to work effectively with people for whom data science sits outside of their subject area.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Targeted phishing is one of the most common and damaging cybersecurity attacks, incurring tens of billions of dollars in losses a year. In order to increase the success of the phishing emails, attackers often craft emails that impersonate real people or legitimate online services, and send them from networks and hosting sites that have a high reputation. This leads major email security services, including Outlook and Gmail, to often misclassify these emails as legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project is to mitigate the risks of commuting for Columbia employees when they will have to return to work after the state-on-pause is over from May 15. As Columbia has been preparing for ramping up labs with an emphasis on social distancing within campus, higher risks could arise when the employees have to commute between home and campus. It is estimated approximately one in five residents in NYC might have been infected by COVID-19 . With the fear of exposing to coronavirus, commuters have shifted from transit to individual cars or bikes, leading to a significant drop in subway ridership , more speeding tickets , surging bike traffic , and more crashes with cyclist injuries . On the other hand, low-income people of color, who have been hit the hardest by the coronavirus , could be in a more disadvantaged position after the state “un-pause”, because: (1) they lack accessibility to other travel modes than public transit; (2) they usually live far from their workplace for an affordable accommodation and have to commute a long way; and (3) many of them take night shift but most transportation options are shut down at night after the pandemic. This project aims to address travel safety and equity concerns of essential workers and provide a responsible and safe transportation solution for the Columbia community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Under United States securities laws corporations must disclose material risks to their operations. Human rights issues, especially in authoritarian countries, rarely show up in the information that data providers offer to investors, in part due to the risks to those subject to these abuses. The result is a dearth of data on human rights materiality and the tendency of investors to overlook human rights risks of the companies that they finance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Machine-learning based methods to extract river flow information from satellite imagery</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Humanity thrives along major rivers – this is as true now as it was ages ago. Our dependence on rivers for agriculture and electricity, as well as the need to control its flow because of our proximity, has  resulted in dramatic changes to the nature of the rivers. What were once great perennial rivers are now mere trickles during the summer months. This puts the livelihood of many people, especially poor farmers, in jeopardy. How can we monitor and document changes to the flow through rivers over time? Since river gauge measurements are rare or non-existent, any way in which we can use freely available satellite imagery (Landsat, Sentinel) to determine the changes in flow patterns of rivers over time would be extremely useful. One such tool is Rivamap – it uses OpenCV to analyze satellite imagery to extract information about rivers, especially for large rivers. What about smaller ones – it does not seem to work as well. In this project, the student(s) will have to develop machine-learning based methods  (or extend the capabilities of Rivamap) to study satellite images to extract information about the path and dimensions of rivers of different flow rates and flow patterns. Comparison with ground-truth data will be needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The question we ask is whether online echo-chambers on social media networks enhance the anxiety and depression of individuals during the COVID19 outbreak. More specifically we want to measure the intensity of the communication about COVID-19 within the echo-chamber of individuals on Twitter and investigate the impact on their subsequent tweets in terms of the level of anxiety and signs of depressive language in their Tweets.  We measure echo-chambers by the number of users in the social network that tweeted about COVID-19. We build on an extensive dataset of Twitter users for whom we have identified a large number of demographic and geographic variables (such as the gender, age, ethnicity, location by state, political affiliation) as well as their social network.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The PHIA project is a multi-country population-based HIV Impact Assessment survey which has interviewed and tested for HIV over 450,000 people of all ages in Africa. We are also currently conducting a second round of surveys in many countries, and hope to use best practices in big data management to generate a combined dataset across all countries. We want to combine this data with environmental, mobility and social media data and then use machine learning to identify trends in HIV incidence, treatment disruption and risk factors. We would also be interested in looking at other ways to use environmental data to predict potential zoonotic outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://cu-dsi-scholars.github.io/DSI-scholars/2020/02/project-understanding-orientation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Orienting to a novel event is a rapid shift in attention to a change in one’s surroundings that appears to be a fundamental biological mechanism for survival and essentially functions as a &amp;ldquo;what is it&amp;rdquo; detector. Orienting appears to play a central role in human learning and development, as it facilitates adaptation to an ever-changing environment.  Thus, orienting can be viewed as an allocational mechanism in which attention sifts through the complex multi-sensory world and selects relevant stimuli for further processing.  The selection of stimuli for further processing has implications for what will be encoded into memories and how strong those memory traces will be.  The ability to differentiate between relevant and irrelevant input, to inhibit the processing of irrelevant stimuli, and to sustain attention requires control, and inhibitory processes that improve with age.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Columbia University &lt;a href=&#34;http://datascience.columbia.edu/&#34;&gt;Data Science Institute&lt;/a&gt; is pleased to announce that the Data Science Institute (DSI) and Data For Good Scholars programs for Spring-Summer 2020 are open for application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the DSI Scholars Program is to engage Columbia University&amp;rsquo;s undergraduate and master&amp;rsquo;s students in data science research with Columbia faculty through a research internship. The program connects students with research projects across Columbia and provides student researchers with an additional learning experience and networking opportunities. Through unique enrichment activities, this program aims to foster a learning and collaborative community in data science at Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Data For Good Scholars program connects student volunteers to organizations and individuals working for the social good whose projects have developed a need for data science expertise. As &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo; problems with real world data, these projects are excellent opportunities for students to learn how data science is practiced outside of the university setting and to learn how to work effectively with people for whom data science sits outside of their subject area.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project builds on a novel cellular model of human aging (Sturm et al. Epigenomics 2019) where we can investigate trajectories of multiple molecular features of aging over long time periods. The underlying multi-omic dataset includes epigenomic (DNA methylation), proteomic (protein abundance), bioenergetics (mitochondrial respiration), telomere length, and various secreted factors. A major challenge for the DSI Fellow will be to integrate the multi-omic dataset to capture dynamic signatures of mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular aging, working collaboratively with other scientists. The existing project is expected to result in one or more publications. Possibility to continue work for pay over the summer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Advances in data collection technologies in neuroscience has resulted in a deluge of high-quality data that needs to be analyzed, and presented to the experimentalist in a meaningful way. Usually the “data analysis and visualization”-pipeline is built from scratch for each new experiment resulting in a significant amount of code duplication and wasted effort in rebuilding the analysis tools. There is a growing need for a unified system to automate much of the repetitive tasks and aid biologists in understanding their data more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://cu-dsi-scholars.github.io/DSI-scholars/2020/01/project-advanced-data-science-methods-to-improve-spinal-electrical-stimulation-for-paralysis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We aim to augment recovery in spinal cord (SC) injured patients. Electrical stimulation of the SC can facilitate recovery, but the mechanisms are not yet understood. One knowledge gap lies in the exact pathways that are recruited by stimulation. To close this gap, we have tested the effects of SC stimulation in people undergoing clinically indicated surgery. By testing the distribution and size of muscle responses to SC stimulation, we can infer which circuits are activated. We are also examining how SC injury changes those responses. We propose to use Bayesian methods to understand the  interaction between muscle responses to stimulation and the MRI indicated pattern of damage. The project will involve construction of models linking multiple data modalities that predict muscle activity, followed by the modification of these models to account for patterns of damage. Construction of such models would enable a deeper understanding of SC stimulation leading to more effective stimulation paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to use deep learning networks to understand which neurons in the brain encode fine motor movements in mice. We collected large datasets entailing calcium imaging data of active neurons and high-resolution videos when mice perform motor tasks. We want to use recent advances in deep learning to (1) estimate the poses of mouse body parts at a high spatiotemporal resolution (2) extract behaviorally-relevant information and (3) align them with neural activity data. Behavioral video analysis is made possible by transfer learning, the ability to take a network that was trained on a task with a large supervised dataset and utilize it on a small supervised dataset. This has been used e.g. in a human pose–estimation algorithm called DeeperCut. Recently, such algorithms were tailored for use in the laboratory in a Python-based toolbox known as DeepLabCut, providing a tool for high-throughput behavioral video analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This position is associated with a new research project co-funded by the Earth Institute Frontiers seed funding and the UN Development Programme in Guinea. Its goal is to develop remote sensing technologies to track environmental impact from bauxite mining in rural communities and to help establish protocols for their use. We seek a research assistant who can (1) develop image classification to be applied to satellite imagery to determine extent and abundance of bauxite dust within specific communities in the Boké region (2) develop methods to make classified images available for download to smartphones in the field and (3) adapt existing application technologies to allow users in the field to upload field photographs and locations of potential impacts they identify. The resulting map would represent a composite of satellite imaged areas of impact verified in the field and documentation of other areas of impact not visible by satellite but already identified in the field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;42% of New York City greenhouse gas emissions result from on-site fossil fuel combustion in residential and commercial buildings; space heating is, by far, the majority contributor. Both New York State and NYC have policies to dramatically reduce emissions that will require a transformation in the way buildings are heated, including major efforts in existing buildings. This transition is inextricably linked to existing energy equity issues that we believe significantly overlap across NYC (and elsewhere). These include unreliable heating in the winter, susceptibility to extreme heat (an increasing occurrence with climate change) and struggles to afford energy needs. Various known data sources for NYC are available, though they are disparate and have not been analyzed holistically. Further, we believe there are potential engineering and policy solutions to these challenges. In this project, the DSI scholar will access (and search for where not yet known to qSEL researchers) relevant data sets, analyze those data sets to identify communities exposed to all or a subset of these issues, and assist qSEL researchers in developing models to evaluate possible solutions. The project has the possibility of extending through Summer 2020, subject to fundraising efforts and the success of the Spring 2020 project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Data For Good: The Consequences of Language Policing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Contestation over language use is an unavoidable feature of American politics. Yet, despite the rise of language policing on both sides of the aisle, we know surprisingly little about how ordinary citizens respond to norms governing language use from both in-group and out-group members. Following Munger (2017), I would like to leverage social media platforms such as Reddit and Twitter to evaluate whether injunctions to use particular words (e.g., undocumented immigrant, Latinx) are effective. I plan to use an experimental approach, where conditional on mentions of &amp;ldquo;illegal alien&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Hispanic/Latino,&amp;rdquo; users are randomly assigned to receive a &amp;ldquo;language correction.&amp;rdquo; Outcome measures would include subsequent use of corrected terms, valence of user responses, and upvoting/liking/RTing behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Decoding behavioral signifiers for choice and memory can have far reaching implications for understanding actions and identifying disease. We use a four arm maze where we are able to observe choices and infer memory in mice, but have access to very few pre-determined behavioral signifiers. Several recent publications implemented computer vision to extract a variety of previously unreachable aspects of behavioral analysis, including animal pose estimation (Mathis et al., 2018) and distinguishable internal states (Calhoun et al., 2019). These descriptions allowed for the identification and characterization of dynamics, which then revealed an unprecedented richness to the behaviors that determine decision making. Applying such computational approaches to examine behavior in our maze in the context of behaviors that have been validated to measure choice and memory can reveal dimensions of behavior that predict or even determine these psychological constructs. DSI scholars would use pose estimation analysis to evaluate behavioral signifiers for choice and memory and relate it to our real time concurrent measures of neural activity and transmitter release. The students would also have opportunity to examine the effect of disease models known to impair performance on our maze task on any identified signifier.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The function for much of the 3 billion letters in the human genome remain to be understood. Advances in DNA sequencing technology have generated enormous amount of data, yet we don’t have the tool to extract rules of how the genome works. Deep learning holds great potential in decoding the genome, in particular due to the digital nature of DNA sequences and the ability to handle large data sets. However, like many other applications, the interpretability of deep learning models hampers its ability to help understand the genome. We are developing deep learning architectures embedded with the principles of gene regulation and we will be leveraging billions of existing measurements of gene activity to learn a mechanistic model of gene regulation in human cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://cu-dsi-scholars.github.io/DSI-scholars/2020/01/project-deep-learning-for-tracking-single-molecules-and-proteins/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project will be focused on creating a deep learning framework for tracking individual molecules and proteins as they move within a cell under various conditions. Using total internal reflection (TIRF) microscopy, we have accumulated more than 10 million trajectories over dozens of experimental preparations with differences in both the imaging approaches as well as the biological context. In our experiments we have captured particles under a wide variety of conditions including increased protein expression level, and a range of drug concentrations. Our biggest challenge is being able to stably track the movement of a particle as it passes by other particles or groups of particles, and to do this in a way that generalizes over novel conditions. The Data Science Institute Scholar chosen for this project would work with scientists in the Javitch laboratory and others across the Columbia campus to conceive of an approach for efficiently and effectively tracking particles. The resulting work would be of great interest to an increasing number of scientists working in this field who currently rely on methods based on feature engineering that are often inaccurate or inflexible compared to modern deep learning methods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;All complex behaviors require animals to coordinate their perception and actions. To successfully achieve a goal, a decision maker (DM; be it a human, animal, or artificial agent) must determine which action to take and, faced with much more information than she can fully process, must decide which source of information to consult to best guide that action. But in contrast with natural tasks, traditional research has focused primarily on action selection but eschewed the process of information demand. We aim to fill this gap by investigating the factors that motivate people to become curious and seek information.  We are collecting behavioral data from a large sample of participants on a battery of online tasks testing various aspects of curiosity, and seek a DSI scholar who can quantitatively analyze the data. The scholar will be supervised by two co-PIs: Jacqueline Gottlieb, in Columbia&amp;rsquo;s Neuroscience Department and Zuckerman Institute, and Vince Dorie, in the DSI. The scholar will obtain training with advanced data analytic methods and the opportunity to co-author what is expected to be a high impact paper with interdisciplinary appeal in economics, neuroscience, and psychology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The ocean significantly mitigates climate change by absorbing fossil fuel carbon from the atmosphere. Cumulatively since the preindustrial times, the ocean has absorbed 40% of emissions. To understand past changes, diagnose ongoing changes, and to predict the future behavior of the ocean carbon sink, we must understand its spatial and temporal variability. However, the ocean is poorly sampled and so we cannot do this from direct measurements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The introduction of a new technology provides individuals and organizations with a large, unowned, and limitless space for communication and organization. How do individuals use or misuse this space in their decision making? Using online discussion platforms, we will analyze what types of discussions thrive - those with depth of discussion or topical complexity or those with cohesive contours? We’ll ask, are there high status actors who are particularly good at recognizing topic gaps which need new conversations? Using social psychological theories with a large-scale archival dataset, we’ll learn more about the impact of new technologies on group decision-making processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Quadracci Sustainable Engineering Lab (qSEL) has several research efforts related to the low-carbon energy transition, including pathways to decarbonize building space heating. Recent work has produced large model data sets that have supported recent journal articles. Several maps have been produced using QGIS and data has been made public, but user functionality is limited. While we continue to build on these efforts, we also want to make our results and data available more widely for other researchers and policymakers. The large data sets (10 years of hourly data for more than 72,000 census tracts and six scenarios) and different spatial aggregations (e.g. states and electricity planning/operating regions) present challenges. In this project, the DSI Scholar would first work with qSEL researchers to develop an interactive web interface to display maps of relevant analyses and allow users to produce time series data from the underlying models. Additional research would include further analysis at a regional level – likely New York State – to refine the current model based on additional intraregional and energy source data. The project has the possibility of extending through Summer 2020, subject to fundraising efforts and the success of the Spring 2020 project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The amount of video content that is being distributed over the Internet is increasing. Video providers rely on HTTP adaptive streaming approaches to deliver video clips to users. Complementary to the video provider, the service provider must determine the priority of each network stream. As part of the project, students will explore wireless network assisted strategies for http adaptive streaming by use of TOS/DSCP. This includes using machine-learning tools to analyze network video traffic and the design of reinforcement learning algorithms to improve users&#39; video Quality of Experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A major challenge to implementing precision medicine arises from patients who share a clinical diagnosis but have different biological causes of disease. Disease subtypes that arise from obscure etiological heterogeneity create inefficiencies in healthcare and attenuate power in clinical trials and research studies. The ability to stratify patients into biologically homogenous subgroups improves the potential for translational research by allowing us to design more powerful studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are constantly exposed to inputs from the outside world, but we do not perceive everything we are exposed to. Some inputs are rather weak: we might perceive them at one point in time, but not at another. The state of our brains right before we receive such sensory inputs influences whether or not we perceive them. Brain oscillations are proposed to play a key role in setting these brain states; however, how exactly these brain rhythms influence our perception remains a topic of active research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scholars would assist with Aim 1 of a new R01 working with our lab and the Health Evaluation and Analytics Laboratory at NYU Wagner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are the most common and resource intensive birth defects managed in the United States (US), affecting ~40,000 births per year in the US. (1) One-year mortality for these children is &amp;gt;10%.  It is &amp;gt;30% for children requiring neonatal surgery. (2) Yet there are currently limited data on long-term outcomes and health expenditures for these children.  Due to marked heterogeneity in disease subtypes and treatments among CHD patients, the power of single-center studies is limited.  Multi-center data are siloed in diagnostic or procedural registries or in-patient databases, or are the product of individual investigations.  Administrative data may lack clinical precision, as ICD codes for this population are not based on physiology.  Further, data on costs and value typically rely on cost-to-charge ratio based costs, which are highly influenced by hospital accounting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tax evasion is one of the main sources of informal economic activity and has drastic effects on different macroeconomic variables. However, due to various reasons, it is difficult to directly measure the extent of tax evasion. This project aims to develop a novel way of measuring aggregate tax evasion in national economies using Twitter feeds. To this end, using carefully selected keywords in different national languages, we will collect country and regional level data from Twitter feeds in different frequencies for a large cross section of economies and then construct a measure of tax evasion using the collected data. In addition to fully describing the collected dataset, the project will also examine the evolution of the constructed series.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Individuals with schizophrenia shows a wide range of cognitive deficits, and lack in the ability to control the variety of inputs (whether internal or external) to create a unitary “self”. This problem has been often associated with a supramodal attentional deficit, but its causes are yet unknown. In the past twenty years, the quest to identify brain regions or networks showing abnormal functioning in schizophrenia has been unproductive; but one question is left unanswered: is it possible that it is the white matter tracts supporting attention (i.e., the superior longitudinal fasciculi I, II, and III) to be compromised in this psychiatric disorder? The present project will attempt to dissect the fronto-parietal branches with DTI by analyzing over 400 images from the Open Access SchizConnect.Org repository (data already available to the PI). Funds will be used to support the work of a junior or senior-year undergraduate student (possibly from URMs) to conduct the data analysis during the summer of AY2020. Results will be made available with the scientific community and published in open access peer-review journals (e.g.,  Schizophrenia Research). Co-mentoring of the undergraduate student will be done by Dr. Henrietta Howells (&lt;a href=&#34;https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=nudmODkAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;oi=ao),&#34;&gt;https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=nudmODkAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;oi=ao),&lt;/a&gt; opening the student to an international collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Milky Way swarms with orbiting satellite dwarf galaxies of astounding diversity. Some galaxies continue to form stars while others stop and dim in brightness. In computer simulations, the evolutionary history of each dwarf galaxy that leads to these differences is known. Galaxies can lose gas and stop forming stars due to early exposure to stellar radiation (reionization), interaction with the hot gas of the host (ram-pressure stripping), or gravitational interactions with the host/dwarf galaxies (tidal effects).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Urban Lead Atlas is a collaborative community-based research initiative to create the nations’ first crowd-sourced open online map identifying toxic lead hazards located within the homes, schools, landscape, and lead service lines for water in American cities. The project will begin by integrating data from a small set of cities – New York, Philadelphia, Washington D.C. and Newark - including housing enforcement and lead service line datasets, data on lead dust in schools, and the results of soil lead tests in parks and backyards, on the websites of Columbia University’s Center for Sustainable Urban Development. Ultimately, the goal of the Urban Lead Atlas is to create and populate a fully open online platform that is capable of integrating data from “citizen scientists” and residents regarding the sites of lead hazards in their city’s environment and buildings. This research is important, as experts estimate that over nine million US children have lead blood levels which may cause sub-clinical effects and permanent adverse health, cognitive, and behavior outcomes. The Lead Atlas is intended as the first model for a national effort, the American Lead Atlas project, which seeks to create a national online collaborative map of lead hazards within American cities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A central issue facing systems neuroscience is defining the rich naturalistic behavioral repertoire that mice engage in under psychiatrically relevant situations. Recent advances in deep learning (e.g., DeepLabCut) have made frame by frame detailed pose estimation possible. However, this dense behavioral data requires new techniques for defining the ethogram (full description of behavior). To date, researchers have used frequency based time series approaches to tackle this problem, with significant limitations. An alternative approach would be to take advantage of new topology methods (persistent homology and directed algebraic topology) to characterize the shapes formed by mouse limb trajectories. Such an approach would have broad application in systems neuroscience. For this project, the student will use machine learning to label animal body parts, then topology to characterize the ethogram and compare the results to existing approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Columbia University &lt;a href=&#34;http://datascience.columbia.edu/&#34;&gt;Data Science Institute&lt;/a&gt; is pleased to announce that the Data Science Institute (DSI) and Data For Good Scholars programs for Fall 2019 are open for application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the DSI Scholars Program is to engage Columbia University&amp;rsquo;s undergraduate and master&amp;rsquo;s students in data science research with Columbia faculty through a research internship. The program connects students with research projects across Columbia and provides student researchers with an additional learning experience and networking opportunities. Through unique enrichment activities, this program aims to foster a learning and collaborative community in data science at Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Data For Good Scholars program connects student volunteers to organizations and individuals working for the social good whose projects have developed a need for data science expertise. As &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo; problems with real world data, these projects are excellent opportunities for students to learn how data science is practiced outside of the university setting and to learn how to work effectively with people for whom data science sits outside of their subject area.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project is the first comprehensive examination of African North Americans who crossed one of the U.S.-Canada borders, going either direction, after the Underground Railroad, in the generation alive roughly 1865-1930. It analyzes census and other records to match individuals and families across the decades, despite changes or ambiguities in their names, ages, &amp;ldquo;color,&amp;rdquo; birthplace, or other details. The main difficulty in making these matches is that the census data for people with a confirmed identity does not stay uniform decade after decade. Someone might be recorded not with their given name but instead a nickname (Elizabeth to Betsy); women can marry or get remarried and change their names; racial measures by a census taker may change (black to mulatto, or mulatto to white); someone might say they are from Canada, even when they were born in Kentucky, depending on how the question was asked; people who were estimating their ages might be 35 in 1870 and 40 in 1880 and 50 in 1890, for example.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Under United States securities laws corporations must disclose material risks to their operations. Human rights issues, especially in authoritarian countries, rarely show up in the information that data providers offer to investors, in part due to the risks to those subject to these abuses. The result is a dearth of data on human rights materiality and the tendency of investors to overlook human rights risks of the companies that they finance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The function for much of the 3 billion letters in the human genome remain to be understood. Advances in DNA sequencing technology have generated enormous amount of data, yet we don&amp;rsquo;t have the tool to extract rules of how the genome works. Deep learning holds great potential in decoding the genome, in particular due to the digital nature of DNA sequences and the ability to handle large data sets. However, like many other applications, the interpretability of deep learning models hampers its ability to help understand the genome. We are developing deep learning architectures embedded with the principles of gene regulation and we will be leveraging millions of existing whole genome measurements of gene activity to learn a mechanistic model of gene regulation in human cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mixture models are a popular technique for clustering and density estimation due to their simplicity and ease of use. However the success of these models relies crucially on specific assumptions these models make about the underlying data distribution. Gaussian mixture models, for instance, assume that the subpopulations within the data are Gaussians-like, and can thus lead to poor predictions on datasets with more complex intrinsic structures. A common approach in such situations is to resort to more complex data models. An interesting sparsely explored alternative is to find feature transformations that maintain the salient cluster information while simplifying the subpopulation structure, in effect making mixture models highly effective.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Designing high quality prediction models while maintaining social equity (in terms of ethnicity, gender, age, etc.) is critical in today&amp;rsquo;s world. Most recent research in algorithmic fairness focuses on developing fair machine learning algorithms such as fair classification, fair regression, or fair clustering. Nevertheless, it can sometimes be more useful to simply preprocess the data so as to &amp;ldquo;remove&amp;rdquo; sensitive information from the input feature space, thus minimizing potential discrimination in subsequent prediction tasks. We call this a &amp;ldquo;fair representation&amp;rdquo; of the data. A key advantage of using a fair data representation is that a practitioner can simply run any off-the-shelf algorithm and still maintain social equity without having to worry about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are requesting a DSI Scholar position for an undergraduate to work with myself and my collaborator Ben Holtzman (Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory, LDEO). We have been collaborating on the development of novel machine learning applications to seismology, specifically unsupervised feature extraction in spectral properties of large numbers of small earthquakes. Our first application was published in Science Advances last year (Holtzman, Pate, Paisley, Waldhauser, Repetto, &amp;ldquo;Machine learning reveals cyclic changes in seismic source spectra in Geysers geothermal field.&amp;rdquo; Science Advances 4, eaao2929. doi:10.1126/sciadv.aao2929, 2018). Currently we are building a synthetic dataset to better understand the features that control clustering behavior, and compare different clustering methods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, there have been multiple failures of large tailings dams that store mining wastes, around the world, with devastating impacts (e.g., &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brumadinho_dam_disaster)&#34;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brumadinho_dam_disaster)&lt;/a&gt;. These dams are unique in that they continue to be raised as waste piles up and can get as tall as 400m. The risk and impact of failure increases as the dam gets taller.  There are several thousand such dams around the world. The concept of the project is to develop a continuous status monitoring and risk analysis of these dams, automatically, using globally available satellite data from multiple bands, as well as regularly updated climate data products. Overtopping of the dam during an intense or persistent rainfall event is the leading mode of failure. Foundation failure which leads to a liquefaction or deformation of the dam is the second leading failure mode.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The microbiome comprises a heterogeneous mix of bacterial strains, many with strong association to human diseases. Recent work has shown that even the same bacteria could have differences in their genomes across multiple individuals. Such differences, termed structural variations, are strongly associated with host disease risk factors [1]. However, methods for their systematic extraction and profiling are currently lacking. This project aims to make cross-sample analysis of structural variants from hundreds of individual microbiomes feasible by efficient representation of metagenomic data. The colored De-Bruijn graph (cDBG) data structure is a natural choice for this representation [2]. However, current cDBG implementations are either fast at the cost of a large space, or highly space efficient but either slow or lacking valuable practical features.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) has received increasing attention with the development of autonomous driving technology. It is believed that multi-vehicular and multi-informative algorithm is the direction of the autonomous driving technology. However, the stability and liability of the communication prevents the future from extensively embracing V2V-based transportation. Rigorous test is required before V2V can actually hit the road.  Compared with the costly field test, simulation tests are more economical and feasible.  To simulate the V2V communication and evaluate the robustness of current V2V-based algorithm, we are therefore developing a simulation platform integrating different commercial software like SUMO, Veins and OMNET++. These software simulate on the actual New York map, and simulate the vehicular communication in different scenarios and platoon configurations.  Our next step is to use this platform to test our own V2V-based algorithms. The output of this research will eventually provide an open platform which would automatically evaluate personally designed algorithm with least manual work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Galaxies in our universe form hierarchically, continuously merging and absorbing smaller galaxies over cosmic time. In this project we aim to identify the most important features of, as well as generate efficient new features from, the merger histories of galaxies. Namely, features that predict (or physically speaking, determine) the properties of galaxies, e.g. their shape or color. This will be done using the results from a large cosmological simulation, IllustrisTNG (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tng-project.org&#34;&gt;www.tng-project.org&lt;/a&gt;). We will begin with identifying ways to represent the rich information in the merger history. We will then compare various ML methods oriented towards feature selection or importance analysis: random forests or gradient boosted trees, L1SVM, neural networks (through analysis of e.g. saliency maps). More advanced models can also be applied, such as neural network models designed for feature selection. Finally, we wish to apply / develop methods that can build &amp;lsquo;interpretable&amp;rsquo; new features by constructing them as algebraic formulas from original input features (inspired by e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/324/5923/81)&#34;&gt;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/324/5923/81)&lt;/a&gt;. The overarching goal is to understand better what in the merger history is most crucial in determining a galaxy&amp;rsquo;s present-day properties, an answer to which can be widely applicable to problems in galaxy formation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Locally advanced colorectal cancers that invade adjacent organs (i.e., T4 primary tumors) without evidence of distant metastasis account for approximately 5-15% of new colorectal cancers.  There are limited multi-institutional study describing the perioperative complication rates and long-term survival of patients undergoing single organ resection after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation versus multivisceral resections for patients with T4 colorectal cancers.  Using the American College of Surgeons National Cancer Database (NCDB), we seek to analyze differential outcomes (perioperative complications and overall survival) by procedure performed, tumor details, pathological findings, chemo-radiotherapy regimens, patient demographics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project works with a novel corpus of text-based school data to develop a multi-dimensional measure of the degree to which American colleges and universities offer a liberal arts education. We seek a data scientist for various tasks on a project that uses analysis of multiple text corpora to better understand the liberal arts. This is an ongoing three-year project with opportunities for future collaborations, academic publications, and developing and improving existing data science and machine learning skills. Tasks likely include: (1) Using Amazon Web Services to create and maintain cloud-based storage (SQL, S3 buckets) of the project&amp;rsquo;s expanding library of data. (2) Extracting information (named entities, times, places, books, and so on) from millions of plain-text syllabus records. (3) Merging multiple forms of data into a single dataset. (4) Scraping websites for relevant information (e.g., college course offerings, school rankings). Some pages may include dynamically created content that requires the use of a program such as Selenium.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2013, the Chinese government launched its grand initiative to eradicate rural poverty by 2020. The initiative has made great progress since then, yet little rigorous empirical evidence is available due to data limitations. This project aims to use big data through both official and social media to analyze the trends, achievements, and challenges of this initiative and offer implications for the future and from a comparative perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Atherosclerosis—a chronic inflammatory disease of the artery wall—is the underlying cause of human coronary heart diseases. Cells within atherosclerotic lesions are heterogeneous and dynamic. Their pathological features have been characterized by histology and flow cytometry and more recently, by bulk-tissue omics profiling. Despite this progress, our knowledge of cell types and their roles in atherogenesis remains incomplete because of masking of differences across cells when using genomic measurement at bulk level. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has catalyzed a revolution in understanding of cellular heterogeneity in organ systems and diseases. This project applies scRNA-seq to define the genetic influences on cell subpopulations and functions in atherosclerotic lesion of transgenic mice for candidate risk genes of human coronary heart diseases as inspired by human genomic discoveries. The students involved in this project are expected to work on: (1) analysis of scRNA-seq data using R/Bioconductor packages; (2) Interpretation of the data using pathway and network analysis. Some relevant workflows are available through the &amp;ldquo;Resources&amp;rdquo; page of our lab website at &lt;a href=&#34;https://hanruizhang.github.io/zhanglab/&#34;&gt;https://hanruizhang.github.io/zhanglab/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A major obstacle to the decarbonization of the electricity production systems is the multi scale (space and time) variability of wind, solar and hydro energy sources. Much work is being done to understand the high frequency variations in these sources from the perspective of grid integration. However, as with rainfall and other natural systems, these variables can exhibit log-log fractal scaling in space and time, such that the variance of the process increases with temporal duration and with spatial scale. Focusing on high frequency variations thus grossly understates the systemic risk that is associated with these sources. Appropriate national grid design including electricity storage allocation, needs to consider both the periodic annual cycle variations and quasi-periodic inter-annual variability which have larger variance, and the phase lags in these variations across space. The proposed project would explore the development of a multi-level, hierarchical spatio-temporal model for wind or solar using data from the continental USA and its subregions to explore stochastic simulations and multi-scale predictions of the associated risk to inform system design and financial instruments development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Autonomous driving is developing rapidly. A lot of breakthroughs of autonomous driving have emerged in both academy and industry. However, many traffic accidents related to autonomous driving also occur and cause people’s concern on the safety issue of AV. To ensure safety and reliability, rigorous test and simulation is required before AV can really drive on road. For AV test and simulation, realistic data is an essential component. Comprehensive, multi-regime and sufficient self-driving data would definitely help the AV development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Taking out multiple patents on different aspects of a drug in order to cordon off competitors is standard practice in pharmaceuticals. In addition to primary patents, firms commonly attempt to acquire secondary patents on alternative forms of molecules, different formulations, dosages, and compositions, and new uses Policymakers in the U.S. and globally have raised concerns that these secondary patents can raise drug prices and restrict access to medicines. One challenge to assessing the impact of these patents is it is difficult and costly to know if a given patent is &amp;ldquo;primary&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;secondary.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our lives are heavily reliant on Internet-connected devices and services. However, to deliver the desired user experience over the Internet, network operators need to detect and diagnose various network events (e.g., disruption, outage, misconfiguration, etc.) as well as resolve them in real-time. We have developed an Internet-wide measurement infrastructure that collects performance metrics (e.g., latency, jitter, throughput, packet loss rate, signal strength, etc.) from vantage points deployed by real users (mobile phones, WiFi access points, etc.) at regular intervals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are interested in investigating how deaths and hospitalizations resulting from opioid overdoses cluster across space and time in the US. This analysis will be conducted with the aid of two comprehensive databases: 1) detailed mortality data across the US; and 2) a stratified sample of all hospitalizations in the US, which can be subset to select for opioid overdoses. Analyses will be extended to drug type (prescription drugs, fentanyl etc.) and subject demographics (age, race, etc.). We have previously conducted similar cluster analysis for other health phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Defective efferocytosis, the phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells, by macrophages is the cause of many human diseases including tumor, autoimmune diseases and atherosclerosis. Enhancing efferocytosis has potential therapeutic benefits. Many key regulators of efferocytosis have been identified, but a systematic approach to map regulators of efferocytosis in an unbiased manner on a genome-wide scale is missing. This project applies innovative genome-wide CRISPR screen to discover novel regulators of macrophage efferocytosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The visual cortex has a distinctive deep hierarchical organization as a result of ontogenetic and phylogenetic optimization. It is unclear what the factors are that shape this particular hierarchical organization. One factor is the compositional and hierarchical nature of our world’s appearance, which may be optimally processed by a hierarchical visual system. Another factor is the need for space and energy efficiency, which constrains the number of neurons and connections. The project will employ computational modeling to understand the contribution of these constraints to shaping the combination of breadth, depth, and skipping connections employed by primate visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Effective representations and analyses of symbolic data, such as lexical data (words) and networks (graphs), have become of great interest in recent years, due both to advancements in data collection in Natural Language Processing (NLP), and the ubiquity of social networks. Such data often has no natural numerical representation, and is typically described in terms relational expressions or as pairwise similarities. It turns out that finding numerical representations of such data in “Hyperbolic” spaces&amp;mdash;rather than into the more familiar Euclidean spaces&amp;mdash;is a more effective way to preserve valuable relational information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finding the exact counterpart galaxies to merging black hole binaries detected in gravitational waves is one of the most pressing problems in cosmology. The redshift of the host galaxy (which has to be measured from its electromagnetic emission) combined with the luminosity distance to the gravitational wave source allows for a direct measurement of the expansion history of the Universe, an approach commonly referred to as the &amp;lsquo;Standard Siren&amp;rsquo; method. To date, there are no proven techniques for accomplishing this goal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Injury, such as falls, motor vehicle crashes, and drug overdose, is a major source of morbidity and mortality.  The interaction between injury and disease is complex and mutually causative.  For instance, patients with Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s Disease or Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s Disease are known to be at heightened risk of hip fracture from falls and in turn injurious falls among these patients can drastically alter the trajectory of the disease.  So far, research on injury-disease interaction has been scant and fragmented.  The proposed project is aimed at uncovering the gestalt of the relations between different injuries and different diseases through a data science approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When a colorectal cancer has grown through the wall of the colon or rectum and into other adjacent tissues or organs, it is identified as a T4 primary tumor.  If there is no evidence of distant metastasis then it is labeled a locally advanced tumor.  Such locally advanced tumors account for approximately 5-15 % of new colorectal cancers.  Surgery remains the principal treatment modality for patients with locally advanced colorectal cancer.  Studies have demonstrated planned en bloc or multivisceral resections rather than intraoperative assessment of margins more likely results in R0 resections leading to better local control and long-term survival.  However, the decision-making for a surgeon confronting a T4 colorectal cancer is challenging because surgery related mortality rates after multivisceral resections are reported up to 12%.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The ocean has absorbed the equivalent of 41% of industrial-age fossil carbon emissions. In the future, this rate of this ocean carbon sink will determine how much of mankind’s emissions remain in the atmosphere and drive climate change.  To quantify the ocean carbon sink, surface ocean pCO2 must be known, but cannot be measured from satellite; instead it requires direct sampling across the vast and dangerous oceans. Thus, there will never be enough observations to directly estimate the carbon sink as it evolves. Data science can fill this gap by offering robust approaches to extrapolate from sparse observations to full coverage fields given auxiliary data that can be measured remotely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A common challenge for students in heavy proof-based courses is to come up with a long sequence of logical arguments from the problem statement to the final solution. In doing so, they can often skip steps leading to logical leaps or downright incorrect solutions. Ideally the instructor should identify these mis-steps and help students master such proof-based course material. Here we want to take a data-driven approach to address this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year one of my graduate students developed a novel algorithm for detecting &amp;ldquo;weird&amp;rdquo; signals in photometric time series, such as those taken by NASA&amp;rsquo;s Kepler Mission and now TESS. An undergraduate students will work in my team to run the algorithm on TESS data, which is just starting to be released publicly (&lt;a href=&#34;https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/status.html)&#34;&gt;https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/status.html)&lt;/a&gt;. We hope to detect strange signatures, possibly including analogs to Tabby&amp;rsquo;s Star, interacting binaries and perhaps even technosignatures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a globalized world we live in today consequences of catastrophic events easily transgress national borders. Whether it’s a natural disaster, a war or an economic crisis it’s likely to spread out and affect all of us. We propose a framework to model global risks that is not bound to any specific model and is a hybrid of human and machine intelligence. The core of this approach is in using Bayesian Nets of causalities constructed by an analyst equipped with text mining and a map of economic, political and business interconnections.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the promise of predictive analytics in healthcare, the lack of continuous internal sensing devices has impeded its realization. With the exception of CGMs, no current commercially available wearable devices yield information intimate to the body. To overcome this deficiency, our research group has developed a minimally invasive wearable device capable of continuous monitoring of glucose and electrolytes in the superficial layer of the skin in an extremely minimally invasive manner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease and related dementia (AD/dementia) represent a looming public health crisis, affecting roughly 5 million people in the U.S. and 11% of older adults. As with other chronic conditions, racial/ethnic and socio-economic disparities exist in the prevalence and burden of illness. However, less is known about how disparities in access to care influence the care trajectories – i.e., the scope, frequency and sequence of services used across healthcare settings – of those with AD/dementia.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Networked systems are ubiquitous in modern society.  In a dynamic social or biological environment, the interactions among subjects can undergo large and systematic changes. Due to the rapid advancement of technology, a lot of social networks are observed with time information. Some examples include the email communication network between users, comments on Facebook, the retweet activities on Twitter, etc.  We aim to propose new statistical models and associated methodologies for various problems including community detection, change point detection and behavior prediction. The proposed methods will be evaluated on a wide range of network datasets in different areas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently Columbia University, Cornell, and NewYork-Presbyterian have agreed to integrate their clinical (healthcare) and business IT systems onto one shared platform called Epic. The motivating factors to move to Epic are to enhance the patient experience, improve and integrate care, and give our physicians an integrated technology platform that supports the mission of an academic medical center. The intern will assist with developing the “operational” analytics capabilities of Columbia University Medical Center including financial, healthcare operations and healthcare quality analytics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Microelectrode array recordings from patients undergoing surgical evaluation have captured typical clinical seizures.  Because of the extreme pathological conditions at these times, identifying single units from extracellular data is a particular challenge.  Our group has developed techniques for tracking neurons through the ictal transition. We are applying them to newly acquired data and addressing fundamental questions about the activity of different cell classes at seizure initiation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The quality of biomedical evidence can affect research sustainability, patient safety, and the public&amp;rsquo;s trust in biomedical research. However, often the quality of biomedical evidence remains opaque to the public. It is imperative to improve the transparency of evidence quality. This project aims to leverage the public data sources, including but not limited to The ClinicalTrials.gov, The PubMed database for biomedical literature, The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database, and so on, to develop and apply novel data mining and visualization methods for appraising the biomedical research evidence, uncovering implicit biases in clinical research designs at different levels, and presenting this information intuitively to the public.  Students on this project will acquire or hone their skills in data mining, results presentation, and user interface designs and evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are collecting and analyzing survey data asking people about the political attitudes and other characteristics of their family, friends, and others in their social circles. Some of this work is described &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/penumbra_paper_11_clean.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and we are also doing polling relevant to the 2018 midterm elections.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Robotic grasp planning based on raw sensory data is difficult due to occlusion and incomplete scene geometry.  Often one sensory modality does not provide enough context to enable reliable planning.  A single depth sensor image cannot provide information about occluded regions of an object, and tactile information is incredibly sparse spatially.  We are building a Deep Learning CNN that combines both 3D vision and tactile information to perform shape completion of an object seen from a single view only, and plan stable grasps on these completed models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The ubiquity of current smart and IoT devices has the potential to transform healthcare. For example, current devices can measure continuously activity levels, heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and electrocardiogram. Our lab is developing new devices which can measure additional streams of health data which are currently not possible.  The summer project will involve visualization of this entire set of data, machine learning, and multiparametric data analysis to extract trends that match health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
