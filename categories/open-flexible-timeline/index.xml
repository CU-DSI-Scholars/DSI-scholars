      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our primary objective for this work will be to build a GMR model that can correct for bias in low cost particulate matter (PM2.5) sensors to be used globally. We will select 5-10 diverse reference PM2.5 and low cost PM2.5 co-locations to build a Gaussian Mixture Regression model (GMR). Recently, our team showed that GMR provides a higher quality correction factor for PurpleAir PM2.5 sensors than multiple linear regression and random forest, in terms of both correlation and accuracy. We then plan to evaluate this model on at least 20 independent co-location datasets that the GMR has not seen. There has been an exciting recent rise in commercially available low-cost sensors (LCS), such as PurpleAir (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.purpleair.com&#34;&gt;www.purpleair.com&lt;/a&gt;) and Clarity sensors, which when paired with machine learning (ML) based correction algorithms demonstrate high accuracy compared to co-located reference grade monitors5,6. So far, these corrections have been limited to the few LCS locations which are co-located with expensive reference-grade monitors, while the potential from the thousands of un-co-located sensors remains untapped. PurpleAir and similar devices have been deployed all over the world. Ideally our global correction factor will allow for the extraction of more trustworthy data from huge open-access databases of air pollution data such as PurpleAir.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the methods to identify novel gene-disease associations is called “trio analysis”, when an affected child (proband) and both his/her parents DNA are sequenced. The genetic information from the child and his/her parents allows for the rapid identification of compound heterozygous variants (i.e. 2 variants in the same gene, one inherited from the mother and the other one from the father).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Structural variants (SVs) are large genomic alterations which can be implicated in disease. This project will focus on using novel genomic techniques to identify structural variants in genomic cold cases with neurological disorders. These &amp;ldquo;cold&amp;rdquo; cases which have previously remained unsolved with standard genomic approaches. We will use optical genome mapping and long read sequencing, together with novel bioinformatic techniques to detect and analyze structural variants.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://cu-dsi-scholars.github.io/DSI-scholars/2022/01/project-urban-design-and-childrens-mobility-and-crash-risks-in-us-cities/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Road traffic crashes involving child passengers, child pedestrians, and child bicyclists are the leading cause of death for people aged 5 to 15 years in the USA. A total of 10,344 children died on US roads in the decade from 2010-2019; a further 4.2 million were hospitalized. Urban design—meaning the overall physical form of cities—is a modifiable environmental feature that can be changed to reduce the immense burden due to child road traffic injuries. Altering the overall configuration of a city’s transportation network affects the way children and other road users routinely travel through urban space, thereby altering children’s risks for being injured or killed in a road traffic crash.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The WHO has identified scientific misinformation as a public health crisis, calling it an “infodemic.” Social media allows misinformation to spread quickly and out-compete scientifically grounded information. Dear Pandemic is an innovative, multidisciplinary, social media-based science communication project led by women scientists across several institutions around the US and the UK. The mission is to educate and empower individuals to successfully navigate the overwhelming amount of information. The goals are: 1) To disseminate trustworthy, comprehensive, and timely scientific content about the pandemic to lay audiences, and 2) To promote media and health literacy, equipping readers to better manage the COVID-19 infodemic within their own networks. More than one year after launch, the project has a combined monthly reach of &amp;gt; 5 million people across 4 social media channels (2 Facebook pages in English and Spanish; Instagram; and Twitter).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A traffic map for the Internet</title>

      <guid>https://cu-dsi-scholars.github.io/DSI-scholars/2021/09/project-a-traffic-map-for-the-internet/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The impact of an outage, congestion, hijacking, and many other Internet phenomena depends on how many users or how much traffic use the route, but researchers lack visibility into how important routes are, and, distressingly, seem to have lost hope of obtaining this information without proprietary datasets or privileged viewpoints. We believe that there is hope &amp;ndash; new measurement methods and changes in Internet structure make it possible to construct an “Internet Traffic Map” identifying the locations (logical and perhaps geographical) of Internet users and major services, the paths between users and major services, and the relative activity levels (traffic, queries, or number of users) routed along these paths. We will construct this map. The realization of an Internet Traffic Map will be an Internet-scale effort that will have Internet-scale consequences that reach far beyond the research community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is highly associated with antibiotic exposure, but it is uncertain which classes of antibiotics confer the greatest risk for CDI.  This project will use the MarketScan database, a large commercial insurance billing database containing 40 million patient records, outpatient antibiotic prescription data, and ICD-based disease information, to test for associations between specific antibiotic classes and risk for CDI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Landweber Lab is looking for a computational student to work with us to analyze long-read DNA sequence datasets from Oxford Nanopore and PacBio (so-called third generation sequencing platforms). These datasets were collected across a time-course while single cells of the genus Oxytricha are undergoing RNA-guided natural genome editing. This process leads to a completely different &amp;ldquo;output&amp;rdquo; product genome from the precursor &amp;ldquo;input&amp;rdquo; or germline genome, and has been compared to a cellular computer. The goal will be to capture and classify long reads in these DNA datasets that represent the intermediate steps in genome rearrangements, when chromosomes mix and match hundreds of thousands of precursor building blocks to assemble a mature genome of 18,000 new chromosomes during programmed nuclear development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Evidence-based Medicine (EBM) is the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. The key difference between evidence-based medicine and traditional medicine is not that EBM considers the evidence while the latter does not, but rather that EBM demands better evidence. Given the exponential growth of the medical literature and the free text format of this big body of literature that hampers efficient evidence computing, researchers, patients and clinicians face significant challenges in evidence retrieval, appraisal, and synthesis. Our long-term goal is to develop natural language processing and text summarization methods to overcome these challenges. Our short-term goal is to build a computable evidence base for COVID-19 and to enable evidence synthesis and reasoning over COVID-19 study findings. Currently we have a database of structured data elements for PubMed abstracts for randomized controlled trials published within the past 20 years. For this scholar project, we expect the participating students to develop methods to analyze the evidence in our evidence base, to build COVID-19 knowledge graphs, and to enable evidence synthesis and appraisal at scale. On this basis, we will also compare the evidence in the literature to the evidence derived from the real world data of COVID-19 patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project is an exciting opportunity to work with FEM, a non-profit that aims to address social rights issues among rural communities in Colombia. The team is currently working with the mayor’s office in Cartagena, Colombia to access multiple datasets and data sources to establish who and where the extreme poor in Cartagena live. Her team piloted a smartphone-based collection strategy during IOTA Hurricane and obtained data on 4845 households in a very vulnerable area. The first data science challenge was to wrangle and analyze these data to better characterize the population and their needs. This part of the project was conducted in the Spring and Summer of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health has been at the forefront of developing virtual interventions (e.g., home BP telemonitoring, iHeart enhanced depression screening app, and COVID remote care program) to improve the management of hypertension, depression, and COVID. We are looking for motivated mentees to help us organize and analyze a wide-breadth of patient data from the Columbia-New York Presbyterian data warehouse to understand the impact of the interventions on patient outcomes. The mentee would work alongside highly experienced biostatisticians and our Center&amp;rsquo;s professionalized data team managers. The mentee will develop expertise in analyzing health system data and will inform decisions to modify, sustain, or de-implement existing programs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the structure and function of the human gut microbiome is expected to revolutionize healthcare due to its many associations with human disease. A critical step in microbiome analysis involves a clustering stage, where genomic sequences of unknown origin are assigned to latent genomes present in the sample. Current clustering methods rely on mixture-models, yet these fail to correctly model the features of genomic sequences shared across multiple genomes. These sequences are of great importance, often encoding antibiotic resistance genes that drive resistant outbreaks. This project&amp;rsquo;s goal is to develop a clustering algorithm that will effectively cluster both shared and unique genomic sequences. We have developed two probabilistic models, both based around hierarchical Poisson factorization, that have already produced promising results. The project&amp;rsquo;s goal will be to refine these models: This will involve robustly evaluating the current models, determining their limitations, and designing new models that improve upon the current. A successful project will enable for the first time, scalable, and comprehensive reconstruction of bacterial genomes. In turn, this will enable a large-scale analysis of antimicrobial resistance in the context of the human gut microbiome. We anticipate a successful project to result in an exciting publication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://cu-dsi-scholars.github.io/DSI-scholars/2021/09/project-predicting-gene-expression-from-sequencing-in-alzheimers-disease/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project is to evaluate algorithms that predict gene expression directly from sequencing data. With the availability of large scale sequencing data in ADSP and progress made in machine learning methods, it is possible to model long range interactions in the DNA sequence to infer intermediate phenotypes such as gene expression. First, we will test a deep learning based method called Enformer that is able to integrate long-range interactions (such as promoter-enhancer interactions) in the genome and predict gene expression from sequence. Using available RNA-sequencing on a small number of samples (e.g. ROSMAP cohort), we will optimize the algorithm to improve accuracy of prediction. Secondly, inferred expression in the ADSP cohorts will be used to test association with Alzheimer’s Disease and related endophenotypes. Finally, we will incorporate datasets that will become available in future such as cell-type specific ATAC-seq and disease-specific gene expression to re-train learning models to improve gene-expression prediction directly from sequencing data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Computational methods for identifying protein coding genes can leverage the conserved translational mapping of triplet codons to amino acids. However, non-coding genes, that are transcribed into RNAs but do not code for proteins, lack this structure, hindering their identification. Deep neural networks have shown tremendous promise in learning useful representations of unstructured data, including genomic data. Our lab is investigating the application of deep learning and natural language processing to the learning of representations useful for non-coding gene identification in bacterial genomes. We are seeking a student to contribute to this work. The goals of this project include 1) the identification and application of neural network architectures useful for identifying different classes of non-coding RNAs, 2) the interrogation of well-performing models in order to identify features of non-coding RNAs, and 3) the design of robust test cases which enable the comparison of these novel methods to existing methods for non-coding RNA identification in bacterial genomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;All volcanoes on earth are driven by the degassing of volatile elements, mostly H2O and CO2 from their host magma. To model the degassing process, one needs to know the solubility laws of these volatile. To that end, petrologists have been performing high-pressure high-temperature experiments for sixty years to determine how much water and CO2 dissolves in magma as a function of Pressure, Temperature, Melt composition (12 oxides) and oxidation state. To model how these fifteen parameters affect solubility laws petrologist have then relied on empirical interpolation between experimental data points and some extrapolations using classical thermodynamic theory to infer the expected behavior beyond experimental calibration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the industrial revolution the atmosphere has continued to warm due to an accumulation of carbon. Terrestrial ecosystems play a crucial role in quelling the effects of climate change by storing atmospheric carbon in biomass and in the soils. In order to inform carbon reduction policy an accurate quantification of land-air carbon fluxes is necessary. To quantify the terrestrial CO2 exchange, direct monitoring of surface carbon fluxes at few locations across the globe provide valuable observations. However, this data is sparse in both space and time, and is thus unable to provide an estimate of the global spatiotemporal changes, as well as rare extreme conditions (droughts, heatwaves). In this project we will first use synthetic data and sample CO2 fluxes from a simulation of the Earth system at observation locations and then use various machine learning algorithms (neural networks, boosting, GANs) to reconstruct the model&amp;rsquo;s CO2 flux at all locations. We will then evaluate the performance of each method using a suite of regression metrics. Finally, time permitting, we will apply these methods to real observations. This project provides a way of evaluating the performance of machine learning methods as they are used in Earth science.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
