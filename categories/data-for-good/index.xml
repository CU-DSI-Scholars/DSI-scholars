      <title>Data For Good: Food Insecurity, Obesity, and COVID-19</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;New York Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center (NYP/CUIMC) serves a high number of racial/ethnic minority and low-income patients. In this project, we will create a data repository of all patients who have completed a universal screen in a clinical encounter for social determinants of health, including food insecurity. The scholar will handle large datasets extracted from the medical record for database creation and data visualizations. The dataset will include patient demographics, food security, and clinical outcomes. This data resource will allow the scholar to partner with researchers to examine predictors of food insecurity, clinical courses, and health outcomes among a large population of patients, including a time period prior to the COVID-19 surge in New York City.  The project will be co-mentored through the members of the University-wide Food Systems Network, a novel collaboration of researchers at the Medical Center, Earth Institute, SIPA, and Teacher&amp;rsquo;s College.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data For Good: Getting It Right: Building Age and Typology for NYC&#39;s Buildings</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Getting a better approximation of the age of a NYC’s building can improve assigning the building to a structural type that includes type of construction and relevant building code in effect. Mapping the age and type of building would help NYC DOB and the City on a number of fronts, which include enabling NYC DOB to be more effective in enforcing building and construction safety and evaluating risk when adjacent or nearby subsurface construction is proposed. Furthermore, the more precise characterization of NYC buildings will improve efforts by the City to craft policies aimed at energy efficiency (TWG) as it drives to 80% GHG reductions by 2050 (80X50) and determining natural disaster vulnerability of its
building stock (HAZUS).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data For Good: Improving observed and modeled air pollution data quality over sub-Saharan Africa using machine learning</title>
      <link>/2020/09/project-dfg-improving-observed-and-modeled-air-pollution-data-quality-over-sub-saharan-africa-using-machine-learning/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of the project is twofold: 1) to better understand and further improve the use of low cost air pollution sensors and 2) to analyze and characterize air pollution data in sub-Saharan Africa. Air pollution kills an estimated 700,000 people per year in Africa, but existing air pollution data in Africa is extremely sparse and estimates of the associated mortality are uncertain. Low cost air pollution sensors have the potential to rapidly revolutionize air quality awareness and data availability in data-sparse areas of  the world, including sub-Saharan Africa. However, use of low cost sensors requires careful calibration, performance evaluation, and other quality assurance before the data can be fully trusted to the same degree as regulatory-grade monitors. As part of a larger project led by Dr. Westervelt, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) sensors have already been deployed in several African megacities, including Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo; Nairobi, Kenya; Kampala, Uganda; Accra, Ghana, and Lomé, Togo. In Kampala and Accra, sensors are co-located with a regulatory-grade PM2.5 instrument for several months, allowing for a direct comparison between low cost and regulatory-grade PM2.5 measurements, and also allowing for the development of calibration factors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data For Good: The Cost of Human Rights Violations</title>
      <link>/2020/09/project-dfg-the-cost-of-human-rights-violations/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rightscolab.org&#34;&gt;Rights CoLab&lt;/a&gt; is working with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) to develop and define a strengthened set of disclosure standards that investors can use to persuade companies to improve labor rights for both direct employees and workers in their supply chains. The project has two components: a data science project and an Independent Advisory Group. Our coalition of labor experts, data scientists, and SASB partners is focused on improving social disclosure standards that drive real gains in human rights.&lt;/p&gt;
