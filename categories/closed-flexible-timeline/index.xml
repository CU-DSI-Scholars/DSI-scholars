      <description>&lt;p&gt;For 350 years the scientific literature has been designed such that scientific knowledge and discoveries can be shared and understood by human beings.  With the acceleration in the pace of research in the 21st century, and the rise of data science, there is now a need to develop a different model for the scientific literature such that the products of the research, currently articles, can be read directly by machines as well as humans.  This will accelerate scientific discovery because AI and Machine Learning methods can be applied more easily to the resulting research products.   This is a pilot project to demonstrate a proof of principle, highlighting the benefits and challenges of this vision for the scientific literature of the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This research project aims at exploring and developing methods to improve and diversify the visualizations of the interactions between the Internet and the topographical and geopolitical space (i.e. space and the political actors that rule over it) through the case study of a region of interest (could be virtually any region that would be of interest for the student). The main intend of the project is to produce a set of maps and visualizations (including infographics where relevant), as comprehensive and diverse as possible, combining Internet mapping with the geographical and geopolitical context of that region. We will build on top of existing techniques for visualizations of the Internet and discuss potential capacities to further model the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
