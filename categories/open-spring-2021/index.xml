      <description>&lt;p&gt;Genome wide CRISPR lethality screens show broad variability in cellular fitness phenotypes across cancer. We postulate that genes with overlapping functions should deliver similar responses enabling functional annotation of uncharacterized genes. Here we will build a network connecting genes based on the similarity of their knockout phenotypes, benchmark this network using protein interaction databases and functional  transcriptomics, and leverage network analyses to identify mutational and transcriptional modulators of functional complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>/2021/01/project-a-recipe-for-creative-recipes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project has a two-fold aim. First, we seek to determine what makes an idea seem novel versus ordinary and if there is an ideal mix of the two. Second, building on these findings, we build a generative model that suggests tweaks to an idea that enhance its perceived creativity and appeal. We will pursue these two aims using 69K recipes and reviews from allrecipes.com. We will use NLP approach to extract important features from the recipe such as ingredients, preparation instruction and review content.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prediction Markets have been used to forecasts outcomes of research interest using market mechanism (See &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/news/the-power-of-prediction-markets-1.20820)&#34;&gt;https://www.nature.com/news/the-power-of-prediction-markets-1.20820)&lt;/a&gt;. A decentralized prediction market, Augur, has been created on blockchain for betting purposes (See, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.augur.net/)&#34;&gt;https://www.augur.net/)&lt;/a&gt;. An alternative approach to prediction market has been proposed in Dalal et al (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040162511000734)&#34;&gt;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040162511000734)&lt;/a&gt;.  This project proposes to develop a new model for decentralized prediction market which can be used to elicit opinions of university researchers on socially important issues. Specifically, the project will use Ethereum based platform to develop a smart contract and an ERC-20 compliant token for researchers to participate in the new market.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Water joined gold, oil and other commodities traded on Wall Street, highlighting worries that the life-sustaining natural resource may become scarce across more of the world. In the state of California, the biggest U.S. agriculture market and world&amp;rsquo;s fifth-largest economy, this challenge is particularly prevalent. Farmers, hedge funds and municipalities are now able to prepare for the risk that future water availability issues can bring in the state of California.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Decoding the elements of mouse behavior that reveal vigilance during exploration</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Decoding behavioral signifiers for the brain state of vigilance can have far reaching implications for understanding actions and identifying disease. We are using high resolution video recordings of mice as they navigate a maze, but have access to very few pre-determined behavioral signifiers. Several recent publications implemented computer vision to extract a variety of previously unreachable aspects of behavioral analysis, including animal pose estimation and distinguishable internal states. These descriptions allowed for the identification and characterization of dynamics, which then revealed an unprecedented richness to the behaviors that determine decision making. Applying such computational approaches in our maze in the context of behaviors that have been validated to measure choice and memory can reveal dimensions of behavior that predict or even determine psychological constructs like vigilance. DSI scholars would use pose estimation analysis to evaluate behavioral signifiers for choice and memory and relate it to our real time concurrent measures of neural activity and transmitter release. The students would also have opportunity to examine the effect of disease models known to impair performance on our maze task on any identified signifier.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are conducting a study at the Columbia School of Social Work to examine associations between adolescent mental health and physiological data (collected through smart watches), sociability metrics (e.g., number of texts, amount of time on social media platforms) and self-reported daily stressors (collected through mobile surveys) and use this data to inform the development of a just-in-time adaptive intervention (delivered by smartphone) to reduce mental health problems among adolescents. Just-in-time adaptive interventions aim to provide the right type/amount of support, at the right time, by adapting to an individual&amp;rsquo;s changing internal and contextual state. We are looking for a student(s) to develop a mobile app (Android and iOS compatible) that has the following capabilities:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A highly collaborative project is available in Dr. Alison Taylor&amp;rsquo;s and Dr. Fatemeh Momen-Heravi&amp;rsquo;s lab. This project aims to identify molecular changes such as mutations and RNA signature of head and neck cancer in Black/African American and Hispanic minority populations with the goal of identifying novel therapies for cancer patients and reduce health disparities. The project entails analysis of DNA and RNA sequencing data. Basic coding skills are necessary and the student will be mentored by both principal investigators. The prospective candidate should be motivated, a fast learner, and be able to work in a highly collaborative team environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease of the artery wall, is the underlying cause of human coronary heart diseases. Single-cell genomics have catalyzed the revolution in understanding of cellular heterogeneity and dynamics in atherosclerotic vasculature. The goal of the project is to leverage published and our own single-cell genomic data and perform a meta-analysis. Meta-analysis allows integrated analysis of much larger cell numbers and helps resolve the full spectrum of cellular heterogeneity and dynamics in atherosclerotic vessels and facilitate therapeutic translation. The DSI scholar will: (1) use the latest bioinformatic pipeline to integrate the existing scRNA-seq, CITE-seq, and scATAC-seq datasets; (2) analyze the integrated datasets using R/Bioconductor packages (e.g. Seurat); (3) interpret the data using pathway and network analysis. Some relevant workflows are available through the &amp;ldquo;Resources&amp;rdquo; page of our lab website at &lt;a href=&#34;https://hanruizhang.github.io/zhanglab/&#34;&gt;https://hanruizhang.github.io/zhanglab/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;5G cellular networks will use high-frequency millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication, which promises high data rates and ample spectrum availability. Students working on this project will help conduct a mmWave wireless channel measurement campaign around the COSMOS testbed (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cosmos-lab.org&#34;&gt;www.cosmos-lab.org&lt;/a&gt;), a wireless networking testbed located at Columbia stretching between 120th and 136th St. In collaboration with Bell Labs students will be able to use unique, state-of-the-art mmWave equipment to conduct these measurements (see pre-pandemic example in &lt;a href=&#34;https://wimnet.ee.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/mmNets2019_COSMOS_28GHz.pdf)&#34;&gt;https://wimnet.ee.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/mmNets2019_COSMOS_28GHz.pdf)&lt;/a&gt;. The measurements will play an important role in the development of network-level control algorithms, which is the other, more analytical side of this research project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>/2021/01/project-natural-language-processing-within-the-concern-project/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The CONCERN project aims to develop models and tools to quantify clinician concern about patient deterioration in the inpatient setting that can be used in early warning scores.  We have discovered and validated several measurable ways within the Electronic Health Record (EHR) to measure clinician concern and have demonstrated that our approach identified patients at risk of deterioration earlier than other methods, which focus only on physiological data.  One of our approaches is leveraging documentation of certain concepts within narrative text in nursing notes that are consistent with concern about a patient. However, this narrative free text is not easily accessible - it is often mixed together with structured or templated text and varies over note types. The steps to be performed are&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>/2021/01/project-predicting-arsenic-contamination-and-heterogeneity-in-groundwater-across-scales-in-southeast-asia-and-the-usa/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chronic exposure to arsenic (As) in groundwater is a staggering global public health crisis and yet, we lack a complete understanding of the environmental conditions that govern As mobility and toxicity in groundwater and are unable predict groundwater As concentrations with enough confidence to make effective management decisions. The objective of this project is to identify key hydrologic and biogeochemical variables that control groundwater As concentrations and heterogeneity across spatial scales in Southeast Asia and the USA. We then aim to develop clear mechanistic linkages and high-resolution geospatial information that can be used with machine learning to evaluate and predict groundwater As contamination. This project involves the integration of various types of large datasets from remotely-sensed and field-collected measurements (e.g., surface hydrology and topography, groundwater geochemistry, climate, and population density). We are looking for a student to advance the connections between key environmental variables and groundwater As contamination across scales. The student will receive experience and mentorship in cutting-edge research that crosses interdisciplinary fields, and will have the opportunity to lead their own project and acquire analytical skills using creative measures, which can involve remote sensing, geospatial methods, statistics and graphing, machine learning, and predictive modeling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The ocean significantly mitigates climate change by absorbing fossil fuel carbon from the atmosphere. Cumulatively since the preindustrial times, the ocean has absorbed 40% of emissions. To understand past changes, diagnose ongoing changes, and to predict the future behavior of the ocean carbon sink, we must understand its spatial and temporal variability. However, the ocean is poorly sampled and so we cannot do this directly from in situ measurements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Air quality is a major crisis globally, leading to about 5 million premature deaths every year. In sub-Saharan Africa, there is little air pollution data available to characterize the problem, and a lack of focus on solutions. Using output from a high spatiotemporal resolution atmospheric chemistry transport model over Africa simulated by Dr. Westervelt and his group, the student will characterize levels of pollution and validate model results by comparing observed data to model output. The student will also analyze results from sensitivity simulations in which sources of air pollution have been artificially &amp;ldquo;turned off&amp;rdquo; in the model. Comparison between the two simulations will allow for source attribution of air pollution, which is important for developing satisfactory mitigation strategies to improve air quality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project is to collect anonymized traces from the Columbia network in order to analyze video traffic characteristics during the work/study-from home period. This information will be used for developing various ML-based tools for Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement. We will perform the feature extraction at the collection time itself and use anonymization techniques (e.g., IP address anonymization), to preserve user privacy. Students will analyze/measure encrypted network traffic to provide ground truth for potential RL/ML algorithms for estimating video QoE and identifying device/application (e.g., the start of a video streaming session). These algorithms can serve as a basis for new video adaptation techniques (see for example - &lt;a href=&#34;https://wimnet.ee.columbia.edu/wimnet-team-wins-3rd-place-in-the-acm-mmsys20-twitch-grand-challenge/&#34;&gt;https://wimnet.ee.columbia.edu/wimnet-team-wins-3rd-place-in-the-acm-mmsys20-twitch-grand-challenge/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The identification of shared genetic mechanisms in cranial dysinnervation disorders</title>

      <guid>/2021/01/project-the-identification-of-shared-genetic-mechanisms-in-cranial-dysinnervation-disorders/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project is to study the molecular background of various congenital disorders affecting the cranial nerves, which are important in senses (hearing, vision, smell), facial muscle movements and more. Abnormal cranial nerve development can cause hearing loss, eye-movement disorders, facial weakness, loss of smell, and difficulties with respiration and swallowing. Some individuals may also have other motor, sensory, intellectual, behavioral and social disabilities. These disorders cause significant disability and are caused by genetic variants, often novel variation or de novo. Unfortunately, disorders affecting the 8th cranial nerve or vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII), important in hearing and balance, have been largely understudied. As various cranial nerves can be affected together, such as in Moebius syndrome, and as the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) and facial nerve (CN VII) also share a path in the internal auditory canal, it is likely that these disorders share underlying genes or closely interacting genes. To investigate the genetic architecture of cranial nerve abnormalities we suggest to molecularly investigate an in-house CN VIII cohort and other cranial dysinnervation cohorts. We will study rare genomic variants (both small variant as structural variants) to identify shared molecular pathways and genes amongst individuals with cranial dysinnervation disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Health care professionals cannot examine every person calling the office with a question nor can they return every call.  Therefore, medical offices seeking to improve the speed and efficiency of evaluating and triaging patients must utilize telephone personnel who are often non-clinical staff.  These telephone triage personnel may be limited in their knowledge and ability to obtain the necessary details of the patient’s medical symptoms and direct medical care accordingly.  Their role is not to make diagnoses by phone, but rather to collect sufficient data related to the patient’s complaints and assign them appropriately in order to get the patient to the right level of care with the right provider in the right place at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Future wireless networks will use high-frequency millimeter-wave (mmWave) links for transmitting and receiving information with high throughput. A key difference between mmWave links and conventional sub-6GHz links is that mmWave links are severely affected by weather conditions. Students working on this project will use a state-of-the-art mmWave radar to assess the impact of wind speed, temperature, humidity, and other factors on the high-frequency link. The end goal of the project is to develop a classifier that can infer weather conditions based on the signal received from the mmWave radar. In this project, students are expected to learn how the mmWave radar works, design experiments to obtain labeled data, perform measurements, and develop the classifier.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
