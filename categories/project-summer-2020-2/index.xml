      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this project we&amp;rsquo;ll be expending on existing family of supervised topic models. These models extend LDA to document collections where for each document we observe additional labels or values of interest. More specifically, one of the goals of this project, is to use additional document level data, such as author information, to develop better exploratory data tools.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We need someone with strong data wrangling capabilities, to be able to determine quick ways to clean and merge data. The format of the data is spatial (GIS) but it could also be manipulated in tabular format.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a 1-year prospective observational study to examine the relation between sleep and cardiometabolic risk among 506 women in the NYC area.  All of the data has been collected and entered int a Redcap database, has been cleaned, and is ready for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>COVID-19 and commuting: How will Columbia cope?</title>
      <link>/2020/05/project-covid-19-and-commuting-how-will-columbia-cope/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2020/05/project-covid-19-and-commuting-how-will-columbia-cope/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of this project is to mitigate the risks of commuting for Columbia employees when they will have to return to work after the state-on-pause is over from May 15. As Columbia has been preparing for ramping up labs with an emphasis on social distancing within campus, higher risks could arise when the employees have to commute between home and campus. It is estimated approximately one in five residents in NYC might have been infected by COVID-19 . With the fear of exposing to coronavirus, commuters have shifted from transit to individual cars or bikes, leading to a significant drop in subway ridership , more speeding tickets , surging bike traffic , and more crashes with cyclist injuries . On the other hand, low-income people of color, who have been hit the hardest by the coronavirus , could be in a more disadvantaged position after the state “un-pause”, because: (1) they lack accessibility to other travel modes than public transit; (2) they usually live far from their workplace for an affordable accommodation and have to commute a long way; and (3) many of them take night shift but most transportation options are shut down at night after the pandemic. This project aims to address travel safety and equity concerns of essential workers and provide a responsible and safe transportation solution for the Columbia community.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Characterizing network behavior in phishing emails</title>

      <guid>/2020/05/project-characterizing-network-behavior-in-phishing-emails/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Targeted phishing is one of the most common and damaging cybersecurity attacks, incurring tens of billions of dollars in losses a year. In order to increase the success of the phishing emails, attackers often craft emails that impersonate real people or legitimate online services, and send them from networks and hosting sites that have a high reputation. This leads major email security services, including Outlook and Gmail, to often misclassify these emails as legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data For Good Project: The Cost of Human Rights Violations</title>
      <link>/2020/05/project-the-cost-of-human-rights-violations/</link>

      <guid>/2020/05/project-the-cost-of-human-rights-violations/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Under United States securities laws corporations must disclose material risks to their operations. Human rights issues, especially in authoritarian countries, rarely show up in the information that data providers offer to investors, in part due to the risks to those subject to these abuses. The result is a dearth of data on human rights materiality and the tendency of investors to overlook human rights risks of the companies that they finance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data For Good: Stick2PrEP - Analysis of adherence for Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) against HIV in observational and RCT interventions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been shown to be extremely effective in reducing the acquisition of HIV.  However, achieving the population-level impact of this intervention is contingent on the identification and linkage of appropriate candidates and ongoing engagement in care throughout periods of high and low risk.  Pre-COVID we had a suite of active studies looking at engagement in PrEP care.  These included  our PrEP database, Get2PrEP (studying individuals with positive STI tests but no PrEP engagement), Back2PrEP (evaluating patients who dropped out of care and re-engaged), Lost2PrEP (survey of individuals who have been out of care for 6 months or more), and our major study Stick2PrEP2.0 a randomized-control trial of text message based feedback to individuals receiving PrEP care and evaluating engagement.  At the time of the COVID pandemic we had just started to perform interim analysis on Stick2PrEP2.0.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are studing the level and nature of gender and racial discrimination at different stages of the employment relationship among US firms, and how the environment affects job mobility of employees. We are using company reviews data and employee resume databases from employment-related websites.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Machine-learning based methods to extract river flow information from satellite imagery</title>
      <link>/2020/05/project-machine-learning-based-methods-to-extract-river-flow-information-from-satellite-imagery/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Humanity thrives along major rivers – this is as true now as it was ages ago. Our dependence on rivers for agriculture and electricity, as well as the need to control its flow because of our proximity, has  resulted in dramatic changes to the nature of the rivers. What were once great perennial rivers are now mere trickles during the summer months. This puts the livelihood of many people, especially poor farmers, in jeopardy. How can we monitor and document changes to the flow through rivers over time? Since river gauge measurements are rare or non-existent, any way in which we can use freely available satellite imagery (Landsat, Sentinel) to determine the changes in flow patterns of rivers over time would be extremely useful. One such tool is Rivamap – it uses OpenCV to analyze satellite imagery to extract information about rivers, especially for large rivers. What about smaller ones – it does not seem to work as well. In this project, the student(s) will have to develop machine-learning based methods  (or extend the capabilities of Rivamap) to study satellite images to extract information about the path and dimensions of rivers of different flow rates and flow patterns. Comparison with ground-truth data will be needed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>/2020/05/project-social-media-echo-chambers-enhancing-anxiety-and-depression-the-effects-of-covid19/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The question we ask is whether online echo-chambers on social media networks enhance the anxiety and depression of individuals during the COVID19 outbreak. More specifically we want to measure the intensity of the communication about COVID19 within the echo-chamber of individuals on Twitter and investigate the impact on their subsequent tweets in terms of the level of anxiety and signs of depressive language in their Tweets.  We measure echo-chambers by the number of users in the social network that tweeted about COVID19. We build on an extensive dataset of Twitter users for whom we have identified a large number of demographic and geographic variables (such as the gender, age, ethnicity, location by state, political affiliation) as well as their social network.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The PHIA project is a multi-country population-based HIV Impact Assessment survey which has interviewed and tested for HIV over 450,000 people of all ages in Africa. We are also currently conducting a second round of surveys in many countries, and hope to use best practices in big data management to generate a combined dataset across all countries. We want to combine this data with environmental, mobility and social media data and then use machine learning to identify trends in HIV incidence, treatment disruption and risk factors. We would also be interested in looking at other ways to use environmental data to predict potential zoonotic outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
