      <description>&lt;p&gt;The growing use of digital technologies in the education system has generated large amounts of data that records educational processes at a granular level. This project aims to leverage large-scale text data and NLP and causal inference techniques to understand the interplay between instructional contexts, studentsâ€™ day-to-day online communication experience, and systematic inequality in academic achievement. This understanding can help educators create a more inclusive and effective educational environment to promote engagement and sense of belonging for students from marginalized groups, thereby reducing existing inequities in the system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disease that requires patients to need lifelong insulin therapy. Diabetes technology (insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors (CGM)) have been shown to reduce the risk of high and low blood sugars and thus reduce long term diabetes complications. Hybrid closed-loop (HCL) insulin pumps integrate CGM technology to automatically adjust insulin delivery from the pump, with the goal of improved blood sugar and better quality of life for the patient. There are two commonly used HCL systems in our diabetes center: the t:slim x2 with Control IQ (TS) and the Omnipod 5 (O5).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
