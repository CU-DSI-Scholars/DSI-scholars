      <title>How Do Competing Regulators Regulate Conflict of Interest (COI) Disclosure? Evidence from Fairness Opinion Providers’ COI Disclosures</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We study how competing groups of regulators regulate the COI disclosure using the setting of the fairness opinion (“FO”) providers in mergers and acquisitions (“M&amp;amp;A”). In this setting, there are three types of regulators with cross-sectional variation in enforcement: the SEC, FINRA, and state courts. Though each group regulates the same disclosure, they all have authority over different regulatees: The SEC has authority over the managers who create the filings; FINRA has authority over the FO providers; and state courts have authority over the board of directors. We examine the effectiveness of each group’s enforcement and the effect of their interactions on COI disclosures. Our paper contributes to the literature on regulatory design for financial reporting disclosures, especially when the different regulatees need to coordinate information or when disclosures have negative implications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Learning from Learners- Designing a Data Science Curriculum</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project is an opportunity to gain hands-on experience teaching data science in an advanced secondary-school environment. This fall, you will act as a teaching assistant (mostly remote, but with some on-site requirements) for a new introductory data science class that will be offered to advanced secondary-school students through the Bard College Early High School program. You will have the opportunity to contribute to the curriculum for this unique course, as well as learn firsthand from this diverse student body about how data science instruction can attract and engage learners of all backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Organizational Statements and Inequality</title>
      <link>https://cu-dsi-scholars.github.io/DSI-scholars/2021/09/project-organizational-statements-and-inequality/</link>

      <guid>https://cu-dsi-scholars.github.io/DSI-scholars/2021/09/project-organizational-statements-and-inequality/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Project focuses on using text (from company statements and job postings) to better understand inequality in labor market outcomes. It will require some data scraping, managing large amounts of text data (e.g., captures from company websites), using NLP to better understand trends in the data, and SML to code key elements in text data. It may also involve running descriptives and comparisons of text data across time periods (e.g., how the language changes).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Towards a combined geopolitical and technical understanding of regional Internet</title>

      <guid>https://cu-dsi-scholars.github.io/DSI-scholars/2021/09/project-towards-a-combined-geopolitical-and-technical-understanding-of-regional-internet/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This research project aims at exploring and developing methods to improve and diversify the visualizations of the interactions between the Internet and the topographical and geopolitical space (i.e. space and the political actors that rule over it) through the case study of a region of interest (could be virtually any region that would be of interest for the student). The main intend of the project is to produce a set of maps and visualizations (including infographics where relevant), as comprehensive and diverse as possible, combining Internet mapping with the geographical and geopolitical context of that region. We will build on top of existing techniques for visualizations of the Internet and discuss potential capacities to further model the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
