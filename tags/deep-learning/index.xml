      <description>&lt;p&gt;Project components: (i) Monitoring of traffic intersections, using birdâ€™s eye cameras, supported by ultra-low latency computational/communications hubs; (ii) Simultaneous video-based tracking of cars and pedestrians, and prediction of movement based on long-term observations of the intersection; (iii) Real-time computational processing, using deep learning, utilizing GPUs, in support of ii;  (iv) Sub-10ms latency communication between all vehicles and the computational/communication hub, to be used in support of autonomous vehicle navigation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
