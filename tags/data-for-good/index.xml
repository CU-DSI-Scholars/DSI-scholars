      <title>Data For Good: Food Insecurity, Obesity, and COVID-19</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;New York Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center (NYP/CUIMC) serves a high number of racial/ethnic minority and low-income patients. In this project, we will create a data repository of all patients who have completed a universal screen in a clinical encounter for social determinants of health, including food insecurity. The scholar will handle large datasets extracted from the medical record for database creation and data visualizations. The dataset will include patient demographics, food security, and clinical outcomes. This data resource will allow the scholar to partner with researchers to examine predictors of food insecurity, clinical courses, and health outcomes among a large population of patients, including a time period prior to the COVID-19 surge in New York City.  The project will be co-mentored through the members of the University-wide Food Systems Network, a novel collaboration of researchers at the Medical Center, Earth Institute, SIPA, and Teacher&amp;rsquo;s College.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data For Good: Getting It Right: Building Age and Typology for NYC&#39;s Buildings</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Getting a better approximation of the age of a NYC’s building can improve assigning the building to a structural type that includes type of construction and relevant building code in effect. Mapping the age and type of building would help NYC DOB and the City on a number of fronts, which include enabling NYC DOB to be more effective in enforcing  building and construction safety and evaluating risk when adjacent or nearby subsurface construction is proposed. Furthermore, the more precise characterization of NYC buildings will improve efforts by the City to craft policies aimed at energy efficiency (TWG) as it drives to 80% GHG reductions by 2050 (80X50) and determining natural disaster vulnerability of its building stock (HAZUS).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data For Good: Mapping Construction and Demolition Waste Flows to Re-Use CDW in the City&#39;s Capital Program</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The State regulates CDW—its generation, recycling and reuse—and collects all data on CDW.  There is no city source of data for CDW.  For the city to innovate policy with respect to CDW by leveraging its capital program as one way to close material loops, which would generate environmental sustainability and financial sustainability benefits, understanding where CDW goes from the demolition process through the recycling process is the most important single step.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data For Good: The Cost of Human Rights Violations</title>
      <link>/2020/09/project-dfg-the-cost-of-human-rights-violations/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rightscolab.org&#34;&gt;Rights CoLab&lt;/a&gt; is working with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) to develop and define a strengthened set of disclosure standards that investors can use to persuade companies to improve labor rights for both direct employees and workers in their supply chains. The project has two components: a data science project and an Independent Advisory Group. Our coalition of labor experts, data scientists, and SASB partners is focused on improving social disclosure standards that drive real gains in human rights.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data For Good: Visualization of water quality data as it flows into the NYC drinking water distribution system</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DEP uses near real-time water quality data to guide its operations (i.e., the selection and routing of water) to achieve optimum quality for consumers. Historical data is used to evaluate the effectiveness of watershed protection programs, and model predictions of future water quality are used to understand potential impacts to the water supply under different infrastructure and climate scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data For Good Project: The Cost of Human Rights Violations</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Under United States securities laws corporations must disclose material risks to their operations. Human rights issues, especially in authoritarian countries, rarely show up in the information that data providers offer to investors, in part due to the risks to those subject to these abuses. The result is a dearth of data on human rights materiality and the tendency of investors to overlook human rights risks of the companies that they finance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data For Good: Data Analysis for a Just Transition in Energy for Thermal Comfort</title>
      <link>/2020/01/project-data-analysis-for-a-just-transition-in-energy-for-thermal-comfort/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;42% of New York City greenhouse gas emissions result from on-site fossil fuel combustion in residential and commercial buildings; space heating is, by far, the majority contributor. Both New York State and NYC have policies to dramatically reduce emissions that will require a transformation in the way buildings are heated, including major efforts in existing buildings. This transition is inextricably linked to existing energy equity issues that we believe significantly overlap across NYC (and elsewhere). These include unreliable heating in the winter, susceptibility to extreme heat (an increasing occurrence with climate change) and struggles to afford energy needs. Various known data sources for NYC are available, though they are disparate and have not been analyzed holistically. Further, we believe there are potential engineering and policy solutions to these challenges. In this project, the DSI scholar will access (and search for where not yet known to qSEL researchers) relevant data sets, analyze those data sets to identify communities exposed to all or a subset of these issues, and assist qSEL researchers in developing models to evaluate possible solutions. The project has the possibility of extending through Summer 2020, subject to fundraising efforts and the success of the Spring 2020 project.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data For Good: The Consequences of Language Policing</title>
      <link>/2020/01/project-the-consequences-of-language-policing/</link>

      <guid>/2020/01/project-the-consequences-of-language-policing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Contestation over language use is an unavoidable feature of American politics. Yet, despite the rise of language policing on both sides of the aisle, we know surprisingly little about how ordinary citizens respond to norms governing language use from both in-group and out-group members. Following Munger (2017), I would like to leverage social media platforms such as Reddit and Twitter to evaluate whether injunctions to use particular words (e.g., undocumented immigrant, Latinx) are effective. I plan to use an experimental approach, where conditional on mentions of &amp;ldquo;illegal alien&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Hispanic/Latino,&amp;rdquo; users are randomly assigned to receive a &amp;ldquo;language correction.&amp;rdquo; Outcome measures would include subsequent use of corrected terms, valence of user responses, and upvoting/liking/RTing behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data For Good Project: African North Americans Database</title>
      <link>/2019/09/project-african-north-americans-database/</link>

      <guid>/2019/09/project-african-north-americans-database/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project is the first comprehensive examination of African North Americans who crossed one of the U.S.-Canada borders, going either direction, after the Underground Railroad, in the generation alive roughly 1865-1930. It analyzes census and other records to match individuals and families across the decades, despite changes or ambiguities in their names, ages, &amp;ldquo;color,&amp;rdquo; birthplace, or other details. The main difficulty in making these matches is that the census data for people with a confirmed identity does not stay uniform decade after decade. Someone might be recorded not with their given name but instead a nickname (Elizabeth to Betsy); women can marry or get remarried and change their names; racial measures by a census taker may change (black to mulatto, or mulatto to white); someone might say they are from Canada, even when they were born in Kentucky, depending on how the question was asked; people who were estimating their ages might be 35 in 1870 and 40 in 1880 and 50 in 1890, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
