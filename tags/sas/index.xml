      <title>Data For Good: Food Insecurity, Obesity, and COVID-19</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;New York Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center (NYP/CUIMC) serves a high number of racial/ethnic minority and low-income patients. In this project, we will create a data repository of all patients who have completed a universal screen in a clinical encounter for social determinants of health, including food insecurity. The scholar will handle large datasets extracted from the medical record for database creation and data visualizations. The dataset will include patient demographics, food security, and clinical outcomes. This data resource will allow the scholar to partner with researchers to examine predictors of food insecurity, clinical courses, and health outcomes among a large population of patients, including a time period prior to the COVID-19 surge in New York City.  The project will be co-mentored through the members of the University-wide Food Systems Network, a novel collaboration of researchers at the Medical Center, Earth Institute, SIPA, and Teacher&amp;rsquo;s College.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a 1-year prospective observational study to examine the relation between sleep and cardiometabolic risk among 506 women in the NYC area. All of the data has been collected and entered in a Redcap database, has been cleaned, and is ready for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Studies Lifestyle Behaviors (Diet, Sleep, and Circadian rest-activity rhythms in relation) to Cardiometabolic Outcomes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I  am conducting studies on lifestyle behaviors, in particular diet, sleep behaviors, and circadian rest-activity rhythms in relation to cardiometabolic outcomes (hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and obesity). Sample sizes of my studies range from n=100 to n=16,000.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Linking State Medicaid and Clinical Registry Data to Assess Long-Term Outcomes for Children with Congenital Heart Disease</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scholars would assist with Aim 1 of a new R01 working with our lab and the Health Evaluation and Analytics Laboratory at NYU Wagner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are the most common and resource intensive birth defects managed in the United States (US), affecting ~40,000 births per year in the US. (1) One-year mortality for these children is &amp;gt;10%.  It is &amp;gt;30% for children requiring neonatal surgery. (2) Yet there are currently limited data on long-term outcomes and health expenditures for these children.  Due to marked heterogeneity in disease subtypes and treatments among CHD patients, the power of single-center studies is limited.  Multi-center data are siloed in diagnostic or procedural registries or in-patient databases, or are the product of individual investigations.  Administrative data may lack clinical precision, as ICD codes for this population are not based on physiology.  Further, data on costs and value typically rely on cost-to-charge ratio based costs, which are highly influenced by hospital accounting.&lt;/p&gt;
