      <title>Defining Aneuploidy from Next-Gen Sequencing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our lab is interested in aneuploidy, or the incorrect number of whole chromosomes and chromosome arms. A challenge in this area of research is that karyotypes require a large number of proliferating cells for analysis. To address this, our lab and collaborators developed new algorithms to identify aneuploidy alterations from DNA sequencing data. Here, the project goal is to implement these algorithms at Columbia, and subsequently to apply these analysis methods to samples generated in the lab and patient samples. Building on this, the DSI student may also develop new algorithms for use with single-cell sequencing data and RNA sequencing data. Experience in one or more of the following is a must: UNIX, R, and python. The DSI student will be mentored by Dr. Alison Taylor, and he/she will also work closely with all lab members.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Generating a graph representation of microbial community diversity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the interaction between human-associated microbial communities and human health is expected to revolutionize healthcare. Recent work found that this interaction is, in part, shaped by genetic differences between otherwise identical species in the microbiome. Detecting this variation, however, is a significant challenge. This project aims to profile microbial genetic variation within and across multiple patients&amp;rsquo; microbiomes. This will allow us to better compare and interpret this variation in the context of human disease, gaining mechanistic insight into complex human-microbiome interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Measuring Liberal Arts: Creating an Index for Higher Education</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project works with a novel corpus of text-based school data to develop a multi-dimensional measure of the degree to which American colleges and universities offer a liberal arts education. We seek a data scientist for various tasks on a project that uses analysis of multiple text corpora to better understand the liberal arts. This is an ongoing three-year project with opportunities for future collaborations, academic publications, and developing and improving existing data science and machine learning skills. Tasks likely include: (1) Using Amazon Web Services to create and maintain cloud-based storage (SQL, S3 buckets) of the project&amp;rsquo;s expanding library of data. (2) Extracting information (named entities, times, places, books, and so on) from millions of plain-text syllabus records. (3) Merging multiple forms of data into a single dataset. (4) Scraping websites for relevant information (e.g., college course offerings, school rankings). Some pages may include dynamically created content that requires the use of a program such as Selenium.&lt;/p&gt;
