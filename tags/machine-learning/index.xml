      <description>Faculty Advisor  Professor Sam Sia Lab website: https://synaptic.bio/organizations/sialab Department/School: Biomedical Engineering/SEAS Location: Lasker building, Room 204  Project Description The ubiquity of current smart and IoT devices has the potential to transform healthcare. For example, current devices can measure continuously activity levels, heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and electrocardiogram. Our lab is developing new devices which can measure additional streams of health data which are currently not possible. The summer project will involve visualization of this entire set of data, machine learning, and multiparametric data analysis to extract trends that match health outcomes.</description>
