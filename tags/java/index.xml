      <description>&lt;p&gt;Data is central to the NYC Department of Health’s mission to protect and promote the health of all New Yorkers.

We are implementing a Master Person Index (MPI) system in order to centralize, optimize and standardize matching methodology for administrative data across the Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
