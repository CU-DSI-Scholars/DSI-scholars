      <description>&lt;p&gt;Town+Gown is a city-wide university-community partnership program based in the New York City Department of Design and Construction (DDC). Under Town+Gownâ€™s organization, student researchers from Columbia Data Science Institute are brought to utilize their academic knowledge in the built environment of New York City. Town+Gown aims to deliver evidence-based analysis of New York City, which acts as a laboratory for practitioners, and make changes in practices and policies based on research results.&lt;/p&gt;
