      <description>&lt;p&gt;We house the world&amp;rsquo;s largest dataset of once-secret documents on industrial pollution, unleashed from the vaults of corporations like DuPont, Dow, and Monsanto in toxic tort litigation. We are applying data science methods to analyze and render this material useable to a broad audience.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Project: Data Science and the regulation of financial markets (application closed)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The development of computational data science
techniques in natural language processing (NLP) and machine
learning (ML) algorithms to analyze large and complex textual
information opens new avenues to study intricate processes,
such as government regulation of financial markets, at a scale
unimaginable even a few years ago. This project develops scalable
NLP and ML algorithms (classification, clustering and
ranking methods) that automatically classify laws into various
codes/labels, rank feature sets based on use case, and induce
best structured representation of sentences for various types of
computational analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
