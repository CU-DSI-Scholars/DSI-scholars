      <description>Networked systems are ubiquitous in modern society. In a dynamic social or biological environment, the interactions among subjects can undergo large and systematic changes. Due to the rapid advancement of technology, a lot of social networks are observed with time information. Some examples include the email communication network between users, comments on Facebook, the retweet activities on Twitter, etc. We aim to propose new statistical models and associated methodologies for various problems including community detection, change point detection and behavior prediction.</description>

      <description>DNA sequence reads from a community of microbial genomes are currently processed without considering sequence variants. The project involves building a processing pipeline of such billions of short reads, identifying closest strains they might belong to, assembling them into specific clones, calling their variants, and analyzing the dynamic nature of these bacterial strains along sampling points.

      <title>Project: Political attitudes and social networks</title>
      <link>/2018/01/project-political-attitudes-and-social-networks/</link>

      <description>We are collecting and analyzing survey data asking people about the political attitudes and other characteristics of their family, friends, and others in their social circles. Some of this work is described here: http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/penumbra_paper_11_clean.pdf and we are also doing polling relevant to the 2018 midterm elections.
