      <description>Question: I applied to the program by deadline. When will I hear back from faculty?
Answer: Faculty will be reviewing applications between the student deadline of September 25th and October 5th. If chosen for a project, faculty will contact you during that window and arrange for an interview or some sort of follow up. Not all projects successfully make selections during that time period, so an update will be sent to all students on October 23rd.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;call-for-faculty-participation-fall-2021&#34;&gt;Call for Faculty Participation. Fall 2021.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Data Science Institute is calling for faculty submissions of research projects for the pring and/or summer 2021 sessions of the Data Science Institute (DSI) Scholars Program. The goal of the DSI Scholars Program is to engage undergraduate and master students to work with Columbia faculty, through the creation of data science research internships. Last year, we worked with 38 projects and received more than 400 unique applications from Columbia Students. The program&amp;rsquo;s unique enrichment activities foster a learning and collaborative community in data science at Columbia. Apply &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQNPZYgxVAcJyaoWUPmJA1WtMYrFEh8bBiG_LNeGSwWYHmhw/viewform&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Question: With only one application form, how do I express interest in more than one project?
Answer: It is recommended that you prioritize based on your interest and skills. To a large extent, the methods of data science can be translated from one domain to another so demonstrating core competency is paramount. If you feel the need, you can address a portion of your personal statement to the PIs of each program to which you are applying.</description>

      <description>Question: How does the DSI Scholars stipend/matching fund process work?
Answer: Stipends are issued directly by Student Financial Services in coordination with the Data Science Institute. PIs for selected projects will be asked to make a commitment as to the level of their support, after which the DSI will arrange for the stipend to be issued. Simultaneously, the DSI staff will work with the PI&amp;rsquo;s department administrators to transfer the base amount to the DSI.</description>

      <description>Question: I am living remotely and have restricted availability during the workday in the U.S. Eastern time zone. Can I still apply?
Answer: Most faculty are understanding of the difficulties of relocation and quarantine endured during COVID-19. The ability to participate on individual projects will vary by faculty with respect to the nature of the project and whether or not there are limitations with accessing research data. Our suggestion would be to indicate your location and availability for online communication.</description>
